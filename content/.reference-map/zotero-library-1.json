Beneath is an underlying connective tissue, known as lamina propria, and a dense irregular connective tissue, the submucosa, which is found at the deepest level. The latter is absent in some oral cavity regions, where the lamina propria is directly bound to the bone or muscle. The oral mucosa can be classified into lining mucosa, masticatory mucosa, and specialized mucosa, with distinctive histological, clinical, and functional features. The variety of functions that the oral mucosa develops mainly includes protecting the underlying tissues from mechanical, chemical, and biological stimuli, secretion of essential substances, and a sensory function, which allows the perception of temperature, touch, pain, and taste .","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Brizuela","given":"Melina"},{"family":"Winters","given":"Ryan"}],"call-number":"NBK572115","citation-key":"brizuelaHistologyOralMucosa2024","container-title":"StatPearls","event-place":"Treasure Island (FL)","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024"]]},"language":"eng","license":"Copyright © 2024, StatPearls Publishing LLC.","PMID":"34283481","publisher":"StatPearls Publishing","publisher-place":"Treasure Island (FL)","source":"PubMed","title":"Histology, Oral Mucosa","type":"chapter","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK572115/"},

  {"id":"cortelliniMucogingivalConditionsNatural2018","abstract":"Background: Mucogingival deformities, and gingival recession in particular, are a group of conditions that aﬀect a large number of patients. Since life expectancy is rising and people are retaining more teeth both gingival recession and the related damages to the root surface are likely to become more frequent. It is therefore important to deﬁne anatomic/morphologic characteristics of mucogingival lesions and other predisposing conditions or treatments that are likely to be associated with occurrence of gingival recession.\nObjectives: Mucogingival defects including gingival recession occur frequently in adults, have a tendency to increase with age, and occur in populations with both high and low standards of oral hygiene. The root surface exposure is frequently associated with impaired esthetics, dentinal hypersensitivity and carious and non-carious cervical lesions. The objectives of this review are as follows (1) to propose a clinically oriented classiﬁcation of the main mucogingival conditions, recession in particular; (2) to deﬁne the impact of these conditions in the areas of esthetics, dentin hypersensitivity and root surface alterations at the cervical area; and (3) to discuss the impact of the clinical signs and symptoms associated with the development of gingival recessions on future periodontal health status.\nResults: An extensive literature search revealed the following ﬁndings: 1) periodontal health can be maintained in most patients with optimal home care; 2) thin periodontal biotypes are at greater risk for developing gingival recession; 3) inadequate oral hygiene, orthodontic treatment, and cervical restorations might increase the risk for the development of gingival recession; 4) in the absence of pathosis, monitoring speciﬁc sites seems to be the proper approach; 5) surgical intervention, either to change the biotype and/or to cover roots, might be indicated when the risk for the development or progression of pathosis and associated root damages is increased and to satisfy the esthetic requirements of the patients.\nConclusions: The clinical impact and the prevalence of conditions like root surface lesions, hypersensitivity, and patient esthetic concern associated with gingival recessions indicate the need to modify the 1999 classiﬁcation.

  {"id":"fineClassificationDiagnosisAggressive2018","abstract":"Objective: Since the initial description of aggressive periodontitis (AgP) in the early 1900s, classiﬁcation of this disease has been in ﬂux. The goal of this manuscript is to review the existing literature and to revisit deﬁnitions and diagnostic criteria for AgP. Study analysis: An extensive literature search was performed that included databases from PubMed, Medline, Cochrane, Scopus and Web of Science. Of 4930 articles reviewed, 4737 were eliminated. Criteria for elimination included; age > 30 years old, abstracts, review articles, absence of controls, fewer than; a) 200 subjects for genetic studies, and b) 20 subjects for other studies. Studies satisfying the entrance criteria were included in tables developed for AgP (localized and generalized), in areas related to epidemiology, microbial, host and genetic analyses. The highest rank was given to studies that were; a) case controlled or cohort, b) assessed at more than one time-point, c) assessed for more than one factor (microbial or host), and at multiple sites.\nResults: Epidemiologic studies provided insight into ethnic and societal factors aﬀecting AgP. DNA analysis of microbes showed some consistency but signiﬁcant variability. Host factor analysis was less consistent. Many genetic studies were conducted but few had either suﬃcient power or looked at multiple genes in AgP.\nConclusions: Conﬂicting data resulted for several reasons; 1) the classiﬁcation was too broad, 2) the disease (AgP) was not studied from its inception, at diﬀering time points (temporal), and at diﬀerent locations (topographic). New technologic advances coupled with a more delimiting deﬁnition of disease will allow for genetic, host and microbial factor analyses in an unbiased manner. As such we predict that progress can be made in identifying a robust group of genetic, host, and microbial risk-markers associated with periodontal disease that can improve diagnostic capability in disease associated with juveniles, adolescents, and post-adolescent individuals.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Fine","given":"Daniel H."},{"family":"Patil","given":"Amey G."},{"family":"Loos","given":"Bruno G."}],"citation-key":"fineClassificationDiagnosisAggressive2018","container-title":"Journal of Periodontology","container-title-short":"Journal of Periodontology","DOI":"10.1002/JPER.16-0712","ISSN":"0022-3492, 1943-3670","issue":"S1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",6]]},"language":"en","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Classification and diagnosis of aggressive periodontitis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://aap.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/JPER.16-0712","volume":"89"},

To fulfill this task, oral epithelial cells follow a strongly regulated scheme of differentiation that results in the formation of structural proteins that manage the integrity of epithelial tissues and operate as a barrier. Oral epithelial cells are connected by various transmembrane proteins with specialized structures and functions. Keratin filaments adhere to the plasma membrane by desmosomes building a three-dimensional matrix., Cell-Cell Contacts and Bacterial Influence: It is known that pathogenic oral bacteria are able to affect the expression and configuration of cell-cell junctions. Human keratinocytes up-regulate immune-modulatory receptors upon stimulation with bacterial components. Periodontal pathogens including P. gingivalis are able to inhibit oral epithelial innate immune responses through various mechanisms and to escape from host immune reaction, which supports the persistence of periodontitis and furthermore is able to affect the epithelial barrier function by altering expression and distribution of cell-cell interactions including tight junctions (TJs) and adherens junctions (AJs)., In the pathogenesis of periodontitis a highly organized biofilm community shifts from symbiosis to dysbiosis which results in destructive local inflammatory reactions., Cellular Receptors: Cell-surface located toll like receptors (TLRs) and cytoplasmatic nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs) belong to the pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). PRRs recognize microbial parts that represent pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)., A multimeric complex of proteins known as inflammasome, which is a subset of NLRs, assembles after activation and proceeds to pro-inflammatory cytokine release., Cytokine Production and Release: Cytokines and bacterial products may lead to host cell mediated tissue destruction.

  {"id":"jepsenPeriodontalManifestationsSystemic2018","abstract":"Background: A variety of systemic diseases and conditions can aﬀect the course of periodontitis or have a negative impact on the periodontal attachment apparatus. Gingival recessions are highly prevalent and often associated with hypersensitivity, the development of caries and non-carious cervical lesions on the exposed root surface and impaired esthetics. Occlusal forces can result in injury of teeth and periodontal attachment apparatus. Several developmental or acquired conditions associated with teeth or prostheses may predispose to diseases of the periodontium. The aim of this working group was to review and update the 1999 classiﬁcation with regard to these diseases and conditions, and to develop case deﬁnitions and diagnostic considerations.\nMethods: Discussions were informed by four reviews on 1) periodontal manifestions of systemic diseases and conditions; 2) mucogingival conditions around natural teeth; 3) traumatic occlusal forces and occlusal trauma; and 4) dental prostheses and tooth related factors. This consensus report is based on the results of these reviews and on expert opinion of the participants.\nResults: Key ﬁndings included the following: 1) there are mainly rare systemic conditions (such as Papillon-Lefevre Syndrome, leucocyte adhesion deﬁciency, and others) with a major eﬀect on the course of periodontitis and more common conditions (such as diabetes mellitus) with variable eﬀects, as well as conditions aﬀecting the periodontal apparatus independently of dental plaque bioﬁlm-induced inﬂammation (such as neoplastic diseases); 2) diabetes-associated periodontitis should not be regarded as a distinct diagnosis, but diabetes should be recognized as an important modifying factor and included in a clinical diagnosis of periodontitis as a descriptor; 3) likewise, tobacco smoking – now considered a dependence to nicotine and a chronic relapsing medical disorder with major adverse eﬀects on the periodontal supporting tissues – is an important modiﬁer to be included in a clinical diagnosis of periodontitis as a descriptor; 4) the importance of the gingival phenotype, encompassing gingival thickness and width in the context of mucogingival conditions, is recognized and a novel classiﬁcation for gingival recessions is introduced; 5) there is no evidence that traumatic occlusal forces lead to periodontal attachment loss, non-carious cervical lesions, or gingival recessions; 6) traumatic occlusal forces lead to adaptive mobility in teeth with normal support, whereas they lead to progressive mobility in teeth with reduced support, usually requiring splinting; 7) the term biologic width is replaced by supracrestal tissue attachment consisting of junctional epithelium and supracrestal connective tissue; 8) infringement of restorative margins within the supracrestal connective tissue attachment is associated with inﬂammation and/or loss of periodontal supporting tissue. However, it is not evident whether the negative eﬀects on the periodontium are caused by dental plaque bioﬁlm, trauma, toxicity of dental materials or a combination of these factors; 9) tooth anatomical factors are related to dental plaque bioﬁlm-induced gingival inﬂammation and loss of periodontal supporting tissues.\nConclusion: An updated classiﬁcation of the periodontal manifestations and conditions aﬀecting the course of periodontitis and the periodontal attachment apparatus,","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Jepsen","given":"Søren"},{"family":"Caton","given":"Jack G."},{"family":"Albandar","given":"Jasim M."},{"family":"Bissada","given":"Nabil F."},{"family":"Bouchard","given":"Philippe"},{"family":"Cortellini","given":"Pierpaolo"},{"family":"Demirel","given":"Korkud"},{"family":"De Sanctis","given":"Massimo"},{"family":"Ercoli","given":"Carlo"},{"family":"Fan","given":"Jingyuan"},{"family":"Geurs","given":"Nicolaas C."},{"family":"Hughes","given":"Francis J."},{"family":"Jin","given":"Lijian"},{"family":"Kantarci","given":"Alpdogan"},{"family":"Lalla","given":"Evanthia"},{"family":"Madianos","given":"Phoebus N."},{"family":"Matthews","given":"Debora"},{"family":"McGuire","given":"Michael K."},{"family":"Mills","given":"Michael P."},{"family":"Preshaw","given":"Philip M."},{"family":"Reynolds","given":"Mark A."},{"family":"Sculean","given":"Anton"},{"family":"Susin","given":"Cristiano"},{"family":"West","given":"Nicola X."},{"family":"Yamazaki","given":"Kazuhisa"}],"citation-key":"jepsenPeriodontalManifestationsSystemic2018","container-title":"Journal of Periodontology","container-title-short":"Journal of Periodontology","DOI":"10.1002/JPER.17-0733","ISSN":"0022-3492, 1943-3670","issue":"S1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",6]]},"language":"en","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Periodontal manifestations of systemic diseases and developmental and acquired conditions: Consensus report of workgroup 3 of the 2017 World Workshop on the Classification of Periodontal and Peri‐Implant Diseases and Conditions","title-short":"Periodontal manifestations of systemic diseases and developmental and acquired conditions","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://aap.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/JPER.17-0733","volume":"89"},

  {"id":"nakamuraHistologicalImmunologicalCharacteristics2018","abstract":"The continuity of epithelial tissue is collapsed by tooth eruption. The junctional epithelium (JE) is attached to the tooth surface by hemidesmosomes, which constitutes the front-line defense against periodontal bacterial infection. JE constitutively expresses intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and neutrophils and lymphocytes penetrate into JE via interaction between ICAM-1 and LFA-1 expressed on the surface of these migrating cells. JE also expresses cytokines and chemokines. These functions of JE are maintained even in germ-free condition. Therefore, the constitutive expression of adhesion molecules, cytokines, and chemokines might be used not only for anti-pathogenic defense but also for maintaining the physiological homeostasis of JE. In this review, we have mainly focused on the structural and functional features of JE, and discussed the function of intraepithelial lymphocytes in JE as a front-line anti-microbial defense barrier and regulator of JE hemostasis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Nakamura","given":"Masanori"}],"citation-key":"nakamuraHistologicalImmunologicalCharacteristics2018","container-title":"The Japanese Dental Science Review","container-title-short":"Jpn Dent Sci Rev","DOI":"10.1016/j.jdsr.2017.11.004","ISSN":"1882-7616","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",5]]},"page":"59-65","PMCID":"PMC5944073","PMID":"29755616","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Histological and immunological characteristics of the junctional epithelium","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5944073/","volume":"54"},

A total of 288 sites in 30 patients were examined. If a space was visible apical to the contact point, then the papilla was deemed missing; if tissue filled the embrasure space, the papilla was considered to be present. The results showed that when the measurement from the contact point to the crest of bone was 5 mm or less, the papilla was present almost 100% of the time. When the distance was 6 mm, the papilla was present 56% of the time, and when the distance was 7 mm or more, the papilla was present 27% of the time or less.","author":[{"family":"Tarnow","given":"D.

  {"id":"tonettiStagingGradingPeriodontitis2018","abstract":"Background: Authors were assigned the task to develop case deﬁnitions for periodontitis in the context of the 2017 World Workshop on the Classiﬁcation of Periodontal and Peri-Implant Diseases and Conditions. The aim of this manuscript is to review evidence and rationale for a revision of the current classiﬁcation, to provide a framework for case deﬁnition that fully implicates state-of-the-art knowledge and can be adapted as new evidence emerges, and to suggest a case deﬁnition system that can be implemented in clinical practice, research and epidemiologic surveillance.\nMethods: Evidence gathered in four commissioned reviews was analyzed and interpreted with special emphasis to changes with regards to the understanding available prior to the 1999 classiﬁcation. Authors analyzed case deﬁnition systems employed for a variety of chronic diseases and identiﬁed key criteria for a classiﬁcation/case deﬁnition of periodontitis.\nResults: The manuscript discusses the merits of a periodontitis case deﬁnition system based on Staging and Grading and proposes a case deﬁnition framework. Stage I to IV of periodontitis is deﬁned based on severity (primarily periodontal breakdown with reference to root length and periodontitis-associated tooth loss), complexity of management (pocket depth, infrabony defects, furcation involvement, tooth hypermobility, masticatory dysfunction) and additionally described as extent (localized or generalized). Grade of periodontitis is estimated with direct or indirect evidence of progression rate in three categories: slow, moderate and rapid progression (Grade AC). Risk factor analysis is used as grade modiﬁer.\nConclusions: The paper describes a simple matrix based on stage and grade to appropriately deﬁne periodontitis in an individual patient. The proposed case deﬁnition extends beyond description based on severity to include characterization of biological features of the disease and represents a ﬁrst step towards adoption of precision medicine concepts to the management of periodontitis. It also provides the necessary framework for introduction of biomarkers in diagnosis and prognosis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Tonetti","given":"Maurizio S."},{"family":"Greenwell","given":"Henry"},{"family":"Kornman","given":"Kenneth S."}],"citation-key":"tonettiStagingGradingPeriodontitis2018","container-title":"Journal of Periodontology","container-title-short":"Journal of Periodontology","DOI":"10.1002/JPER.18-0006","ISSN":"0022-3492, 1943-3670","issue":"S1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",6]]},"language":"en","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Staging and grading of periodontitis: Framework and proposal of a new classification and case definition","title-short":"Staging and grading of periodontitis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://aap.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/JPER.18-0006","volume":"89"},
