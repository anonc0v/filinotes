# Action Items

# Title

Rest functions:
1. direct forces along long axis of tooth
2. prevent extrusion
3. indirect retainer 

Preparation
- no need for anesthesia
- done after the proximal plates and enameloplaty (changing HOC)
- on sound tooth structure, crown, and resin
- not on amalgam
- if emax crown, 1.5mm below occlusal plane (overredduction)

Types of rest
- extracoronal
- intracoronal (precision and semi-precision) (attaches - what its called in spanish)

Precision:
- two metal components. One called "box" or MAtrix which is placed on the prosthetic crown of the abutment teeth. The other component is a metal extension called Patrix, and it belongs in the RPD. 
- pre-made

Semi-precision:
- made by lab

occlusal rest seats
- rounded triangular shape 
- 1-1.5mm of depth
- base of the triangular shape is at the
- 1/3rd B-L width in molars
- 1/2 bucco-lingual width in bicuspids

always do it with diamond bur

Single occlusal rest next to edentulous
- prepared conventionally

if it has teeth next
- prepare slightly lingual 

embrasure
- may pass buccal and lingual contact areas 

Cingulum rest seat - inverted V shape 

Major Connector

Requirements
- rigid
- location
- food impaction
- comfort

Rigidity

Donder's space (1875)
Located at the rugae, tongue won't touch that space 

Comfort - smooth transition

Maxillary major connectors 
- location of edentulous space 
- required amount of support
- required degree of rigidity patient preference
- anticipated loss of nature teeth
- location of the fulcrum lane

borders 6mm from gingival margin - in maxillary; if not, you cover cingulum 

Type of maxillary 
1. Posterior palatal strap or bar
indications:
- for most maxillary tooth borne rpds 
- tooth-mucosa borne rpd when minimal palatal support is required. 

2. anterior-posterior palatal strap 
indications:
tooth borne, tooth-mucosa borne when replacement of anterior and posterior teeth is required, when torus is present 

3. Anterior palatal plate, U-shaped or horse-shoe
-used when anterior teeth must be replaced
- tends to be less rigid than other connectors  

4. full palatal plate  
indications 
- maximum tissue support is required 
- of choise in long span distal extension 

Indications 
distal extention: full palatal plate 
no need for extra support: palatal strap 
abutments periodontally involved: full palatal plate 
anterior teeth absent: U shape, full palatal plate 
torus: U shape, anterior-posterior palatal strap

Mandibular major connector 
- 3mm or more below the free  gingival margin

Relief areas 
- more relief area in mucosa-tooth borne RPDs

desin specification 
- minimum 4mm thick 

Method to measure the functional depth of lingual vestibule 
Periodontal probe: Tip of the tongue should be placed lightly with the center of the lip 

Lingual Bar
- may be used when the functional depth of vestibule is 7mm
- half-pair shaped ..

Sublingual bar
- at least 3mm from gingival margin 
- 2mm height 3-4mm width?? 

Lingual Plate 
- if functional depth of lingual vestibule is less than 5mm 
- future loss of natural teeth is anticipated 

Continuous bar retainer (Kennedy bar, double lingual bar) 

Labial bar
- extreme lingual 

Minor connector 
- 5mm from other components 

Proximal plate minor connector 

Retainers 

Intracoronal - are attachments - act as rest and clasp 
extracoronal 

Requirements 
support 
-resistance to gingival displacement (occlusal rest)
Reciprocity 
- can be a clasp or minor connector 
Retention 
- terminal third: flexible 
	- if you need to adjust it, pliers on tip third, not on first 2/3rd because that's rigid 

Extracoronal retentive clasp 
- thinner clasp 

Suprabulge
1. circumferential (akers)

embrasure (double akers) 
- 2 rest, two retentive arms, two bracing arm 

C clasp 

Bar clasp - i bar, L bar, J bar, etc. 

RPA/RPC 
- rest, proximal plate, akers 

Requirements 

Indirect Retainers 
- part

Types of bases
metal 
resin-metal 

Metal base 
- the metal is in contact with the edentulous space. the teeth are inserted to the rube in the framework 

Acrylic Resin Bases  
- acrylic in contact with the edentulous space 
- the most common type used 

If patient is allergic, normally allergic to the metal not the resin but it's still possible.  

Open Lattice or Retention Mesh 

Needs tissue stop in Mandibular 

Denture teeth 
- acrylic Resin 

Principles of partial denture design 
kiss principle 

tooth borne rpd design 

# Complete Dentures 

# Tray 
- convential - tray 
- custom tray 

Different types of alginates 
- high stability
	- 45s to do impression hydrogum5 - fast setting 
	- pediatric patients, gaggers, 
- extra elastic - hydrogumsoft 
	- 1 minute
	- for edentulous patients 
- neocolloid - high precision 
- stoppers - 

classify tissue:
- thick and fibrotic
- average
- thin and fragile 

if flabby tissue, better to remove and wait 6 weeks after surgery 

to find rest position: ask patient to breath then relax; when they close it will be maximum intercuspation: freeway space is 72mm

use monophase for final impression; light body in areas that are flabby 

soft reline - 2 weeks after full mouth extraction 
hard reline - 3-4 months after full mouth exo
