# RPD

# JPD Glossary of terms

resist forces of dislodgement along path of displacement
stability
support

primary supporting area
mx
- palate
- tuberosity
md
- pad
- buccal shelf

abutment
- tooth/portion of dental implant that serves as an anchorage

rest 
- rigid extension of rpd that contacts the occlusal, incisal, cingulum or lingual surface of a tooth or restoration 

Rest seat

guiding planes

reciprocal clasp

clasp assembly
- retentiive clasp + reciprocal clasp + rest + minor connector
- part of a rpd that acts as a direct reatiner and or stabilizer for a prosthesis by partially encompassing or contacting an abutment tooth .

indirect retainer
- component of rpd that assist the direct retainer in preventing di...

major connector - joins components on one side of the arch to the other
minor connector 
base - supports artificial dentition 

Support: resistance to vertical seating forces 
- rest (all rpds)
- major connectors. maxillary tooth-mucosa bornd RPDs
- denture bases (mx and md tooth mucosa borne rpds)

Stability (bracing): resistance at horizontal, lateral, or torsonal forces 
- minor connectors 
- proximal plates
- rigid portions of clasp 
- lingual plates 
- rests (when the walls of the rests are parallel to the path of placement)
- denture bases (tooth mucosa borne prosthesis)

Retention: resistance to vertical dislodging forces 
- direct retainer 
- indirect retainer 

# Diagnostic aids
- medical history
	- pain? where? why?
	- previous dental treatment (esp. previous RPD experience)
		- if it works, copy design; if they don't wear it, change something
	- parafunctional habits 
- Mounted diagnositc cast 
	- occlusion (cclusal plane)
	- retentive areas 
	- tooth position (inclination or contours)
	- interarch distance 
- preliminary design of the partial denture 
- sequence of treatment 
- path of placement and dislodgement 
- Visual examination 

Basic crieteria for patient selection 
- acceptable emotional and physical health 
- general physical and mental capacity to tolerate a prosthesis 
- degree of patient motivation 
- patient's comprehension of potential success or failure of a treatment 
- patient's dietary habits 
- periodontal health 

# biomechanical classification of RPD

1. Based on nature of supporting tissue
- mucosa borne 
	- regardless of natural teeth present, support is driven entirely from the muco-osseous segment
- tooth borne: 
	- abutment teeth border all edentulous areas where tooth replacement is planned
	- functional forces are transmittted through abutment teeth to bone 
- tooth-mucosa borne 

2. Kennedy's classification 
- class I 
- class ii
- class iii 
- class iv - can't have modifications 

# Dr. Oliver C applegate
- made some rules 
applegate's rules 
1. classification should follow rather than precede extraction
2. if the 3rd molar is missing not not to be replaced, not considered int he classification 
3. if 3rd molar is present and to be used as an abutment, it is considered in the classification 
4. if the second molar is missing and not be replaced, not considered in the classification 
5. the most posterior edentulous area determines the classification 
6. edentulous areas other than those determining classification are called modification spaces 
7. the extent of the modification is not considered, only the number 
8. there is no modification space in class IV  (because it will fall into another classifciation if another post tooth is missing)

# Sustentability 
- the paper with all the design elements/drawing 
- rest placement - closest to edentulous space for tooth borne 
- for tooth-mucosa borne rpds - furthest from edentulous space 
- kennedy's

Treatment purposes
- preserve reamining teeth and supporting structures
- restore esthetics and phonetics 
- restore and/or improve mastication
- restore health, comfort, and quality of life

## Alternatives to RPD 
No treatmnet, shortened dental arch 
- if you leave premolars only, the forces of mastication only decrease 17%
- requires anterior teeth + 4 occlusal units (symmetric loss) or 6 occlusal units 
FPD 
implant-supported prosthesis 
CD

Indications for RPD 
- can't use a fixed prosthesis 
- reduced periodontal support of remaining teeth (won't support a fixed prosthesis
- mental of fiscal conditions of the patient can't allow to get a fixed bridge or implant 
- excessive alveolar bone loss (esthetic problem) 
- cleft palate 
- finances 
- recent extractions or implants in oseointegration phase 
- there is no abutment in distal end 
- long edentulous space that can cause breakage of the fixed bridge due to mandibular flexion 

Mandibular flexion 
- flexion caused by the lateral pterygoid muscles causing breakage of fpd that's why not a good idea to put a 4unit fixed bridge on mandible
- christensen

mandibular flexure
- decrease in the mandibular width from rest position to a forced protrusive and wide open position 

Decrease in wide open position: 0.4mm
decrease in protrusive: 0.5mm

mandibular arch width narrowed from 20 to 437 um during forced opening 
chen journal ofdentistry, 2000 vol. 28

decrease in open wide position to 0.9mm
- christensen, gordon, jpd, 1981 

Mandibular flexure 
clinical implications
- the mandible may flex during impression making, producing an inaccurate cast 
- flexure during mandibular manipulation for centric relation records could lead to improperly oriented casts 
- may influence the stress on abutment teeth 
- may effect the ultimate stability of a lower denture 
- -christenson, gordon, jpd, 1981 

Contraindications for rpd 
- when you can use a fixed prostheses 
- no good oral health 
- non-cooperation of the patient 

selection and analysis of abutment for rpd 
- good periodontal health 
- no tooth movement 
- root surface area 
- structurally sound 
- number of abutments 
- position in the arch 
- crown to root ratio 
- axial inclination 

Selection of an abutment 
crown to root ratio:
- from alveolar crest ot tip of the occlusal table, and compared to the length of the root inside the alveolar borne 
- ideal: 1:2
- optima; 2:3
- minimal: 1:1 

Which abutment to choose?
- the one that has more sound tissue 
- the one that needs minor restoration (composite or inlays) 
- the ones that has endodontic treatment and needs a post-crown or simple crown 

Fulcrum Line
- a spot where it tends to rotate 
- an imaginary line, connecting occlusal rests, around which a rpd tends to rotate under masticatory forces 
- the determinants for the fulcrum line are usually the cross-arch occlusal rest on the most distally located abutments 

indirect retainers used only on tooth-mucosa born; b/c if tooth-borne there won't be a fulcrum line that will be needed for indirect reatiner 

fulctrum line
- in tooth borne rpds not for toth born 

Surveyor
- path of insertion (for removal)
- path along which a prosthesis is place intraorally. a rpd is uaully fabricated to have a single path of insertion 

Single path of insertion is advantageous b/c it:
- equalizes retention on all abutments 
- provides bracing and cross-arch stabilization
- minimzes torquing forces of the rpd 
- allows the partial denture to be removed w/o encountering interferences
- directs forces along the long axes of the teeth 
- provides frictional retention from contact of parallel surfaces not the teeth 

Guide planes
Tooth with normal contour 
flattened guiding plane prepared on proximal surface 
- axial surfaces prepared 

proximal plates 

dental surveyor 
- find height of contours 

Uses of a surveyor 
-placing intraocoronal retainers 
- check undercuts 
- contouring wax patterns for fixeed resotrations 
- machining parallel surfaces on cast restorations 
- recording cast positions
- mark height of contour 

Parts of a surveyor 
- surveying arm
- surveying tools 
- surveying 

Surveying table (cast holder)
surveying tools 
- analyzing rod 
	- a thin straight metal rod used to analyze contours and undercuts.  This is the principal tool used in surveying 
- carbon marker 
	- similar to pencil leads. used to mark the location of the height of contour on a dental cast 
- metal gauge 
- wax trimmer 

Selecting th epath of insertion 
1. occlusal plane parallel to floor 
2. tripod the diagnostic cast so that the selected path of insertion may be easily found for sure reference 

The surveyed cast should be nearby for comparison, so that the bur can be placed in the same relationship to the tooth. 

Diamond straight cylindrical bur
- parallel surfaces are prepared intraorally 
- should follow buccal lingual contour 

Guiding planes 
- should be 1/2 to 1/3 of the axial height of the tooth (a minimum of 2 mm in height) 
- guide planes for distal-extension cases should be slightly shorter to avoid torque of the abutment teeth 

Surveying the master casts 
- after making the abutments modifications intraorally (guiding planes, rests, indirect retainers) an impression with PVS and a custom tray should be taken
