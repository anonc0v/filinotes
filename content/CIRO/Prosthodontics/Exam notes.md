TMJ & Occlusion

vestibule-lingual stability (bucco-lingual stability) 

A contact - nonfunctional of upper to functional of lower

B contact - functional to functional

C contact - functional of upper to nonfunctional of lower 
# interocclusal contacts divided according to function:

- stoppers - usually marginal EDGES; stops closure of jaws; neautralize forces by the balancers

- stabilizers - usually found in the decline of a pit, found in triangular and supplementary edges; balance forces by the closing stoppers; 

  

tripodism

- 3-point contact obtained by stamping cusp to fossa

- 3-points are 2 stabilizers and 1 stopper, or 2 stoppers and 1 stabilizer 

  

Opening movement:

Rotation: 25mm

Translation: >25mm

Myofascial pain syndrome
- has trigger points
	- hypersensitive, hard bands of muscle tissues
	- has nodules
	- can cause referred pain 
- has referred pain
- due to muscle overuse - grind teeth during sleep (nocturnal bruxism)
- pterygoid muscles - main culprits of TMJ pain in TMJ region; sore throats, difficulty swallowing

Treatment options
- relaxation therapy
- night guard
- medication - muscle relaxants, nsaids, botox, trigger point release techniques

Co-contraction
- response of CNS to an injury or threat
- tend to be modified to protect damaged part
- CNS increases antagonist muscle activity during agonist co-contraction 
- increased activity is mild and undetecatable on electromyography 

Muscular Pain
- response to a sustained protective co-contraction 
- produced from a nociceptive focus located in a muscle tissue that originates from the CNS 
- muscular fatigue 

# Biomech:

# Cast metal/Gold crown reduction

Occlusal: 1-1.5mm 

# PFM/PFZ reduction 
- chamfer/shoulder: 1-1.50mm

# thickness of enamel
Premolars: from cervical to pulp = 2-2.5mm
From cusp to pulp horn - 5-5.5mm
Molars - Cusp to pulp = 5-7mm 

Principles:
1. preservation of tooth structure
2. retention and stability 
3. structural durability
4. marginal integrity 
5. preservation of the periodontium 

TOC: total occlusal convergence = 10 to 16o; 16o is optimal 

# Minimum Height
- **3mm**: Anteriors and Premolars
- **4mm:** Molars 

## Axial Groove 
- as coronal as possible 
- not touch finish line
- longest tooth surface 

metal restorations chamfer min depth: 0.3mm 

Subgingival margins prohibited EXCEPT in the following situations:
- aesthetic demands
- removal of caries 
- gingival fractures of the teeth 
- to restore previous subgingival restorations 
- gain retention and stability 
- root sensitivity 

Upper molars = rhomboid shape 
mandibular molars = rectangular shape 
Premolars and the anterior teeth = oval shape

# provisionals
 Objectives:
 - pulp protection
 - position stability 
 - maintain occlusal function 
 - cleaning 
 - strength 
 - esthetic

## emergence profile 
- maintains shape of interdental papilla , proximal contours, and natural gingival appearance 

PFM Step by step:
- occlusal alignment grooves/ depth guides 
- occlusal reduction 
- axial alignment grooves/ depth guides 
- axial reduction 
- reduction of interproximal contacts 
- finishing and polishing

Summary of ABC planes: 
- A and B plane on functional cusp 
- A plane = functional cusp bevel 
- A plane parallel to C plane 
- B plane = occlusal cusp slope of functional cusp 
- C plane = occlusal cusp slope of nonfunctional cusp

A plane - 
- parallel to C plane
- Functional cusp bevel
	- Mx - Lingual side of Lingual cusp
	- Md - Buccal side of Buccal cusps

Curve of Wilson creates a slight facial line of draw![[Screenshot 2024-02-12 at 19.09.17.png]]

Cusp tips line up
- check adjacent tooth's cusp tip and compare with the tips of the reduced cusps on your preparation

- Assess draw 12 inches away with one eye closed
- 0.5mm bevel from occlusal to facial
	- use slow speed for control
	- basically just round off the edges

	- to break contact, hold bur straight up and down and then reduce by sweeping upwards
