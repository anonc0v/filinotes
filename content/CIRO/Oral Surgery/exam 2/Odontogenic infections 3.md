# Odontogenic infections 3

(TC) **CT scan** - looks like a cyclone, more expensive
Cone beam - looks like a cone, smaller images, lower radiation
IRM (MRI)
PA
OPG (panorex)

TC
Mardini S, Gohel A. imaging of odontogenic infections: doi.org/10.1016/j.rcl.2017.08.003

how to write CT scan order

Patient management
1. determine the severity of infections 
2. evaluate host defenses
3. Decide on the setting of care
4. **treat surgically** 
5. **support medically** - with antibiotics, not painkillers
6. choose and prescribe antibiotic therapy 
7. Administer the antibiotic properly 
8. evaluate the patient frequently 

most dangerous complication of odontogenic infection = upper airway blockage 
- if patient comes in with swollen face from lower mandible until below orbit 
- if you determine that it's buccal and infraorbital space infection 
	- then you can ask other questions to determine the extent of the infection 
	- are you having trouble breathing?
	- pterygoid and pharygneal space - if patient feels something irritating their throat 

in maxillofacial region, if you use slow and potent antibiotics (like amoxicillin, azithromycin, etc) it will take 72 hours to work.  

only patients with prosthetic heart devices will receive antibiotic prophylaxis 
- [ ] guidelines 

antiobitics prescribe 3x a day 7-10 days; -specify 8hours per day 

Antibiotics 
amoxicillin is the most effective

everytime you do a surgical extraction, prescribe antibiotics

Antibiotics in hospital:
in-patient:
ampicillin/sulbactam
clindamycin
penicillin + metronidazole
ceftriaxone
penicillin allergy
clindamycin moxifoxacin
vancomycin + metronidazole 
out-patient
amoxicillin 
clindamycin
azithromycin 
Penicillin allergy 
clindamycin 
azithromycin 
metronidazole 
moxifoxacin 

1st day - surgical treatment 
after 3rd day of abx treatment, you evaluate patient 
on the 7th day after the 3rd day, evaluate 

IV antibiotic therapy 
1. trismus (mouth opening between 10 and 20mm)
2. cellulitis (infection may not have drained completely)
3. lymphadenopathy (lymph nodes may harbor residual infection)
4. temperature > 101F (bacteremia)
5. osteomyelitis 
6. severe soft tissue involvement (eg. necrotizing fascitis)
7. swelling extends beyond alveolar anatomy 
8. systemically compromised patient 

1. failed earlier mgt 
2. toxic appearance
3. signs of dehydration
4. dyspnea
5. difficulty swallowing
6. airway compromise 
7. signs of ascending or descending facial infections 

Medical Record
- previous symptoms?
- previous treatment?
- evolution time?
- current symptoms 
- urine output?

Factors associated with immune system compromise  
- diabetes 
- steroid therapy 
- organ trnasplants
- malignancy
- chemotherapy
- chronic renal disease
- malnutrition
- alcoholism
- end stage AIDS

Surviving sepsis campaign
1. *act quickly upon sepsis * septic shock recognition
2. Minimize time to treatment - sepsis & septic shock are medical emergencies 
3. monitor closely for response to intervtions 
4. communicate sepsis status in hand-offs 
- may or may not be completed in the first hour after sepsis recognition 

Hour-1 Bundle: initial resuscitation for sepsis and septic shock
1) measure lactate level (remeasure lactate if initial lactate elevated >2 mmol/L)
2) obtain blood cultures before administering antibiotics 
3) administer broad-spectrum antibiotics 
4) begin rapid administration of 30mL/kg crystalloid for hypotension or lactate â‰¥4mmol/L 
5) apply vasopressors if hypotensive during or after fluid resuscitation to maintain a mean arterial pressure â‰¥65 mm Hg.

Surgical Treatment - peterson's 

1 canine muscle
4 mental never and buccinator muscle 

drainage isn't to take pus out, it's so that the wound does not close
