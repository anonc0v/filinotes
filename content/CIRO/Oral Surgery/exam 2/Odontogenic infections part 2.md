# Odontogenic Infections part 2

- pediatric patients: buccal and canine spaces - most common swellings/fascial space infection 
- everytime you see an odontogenic infection spreading to the surrounding soft tissues, consider sending to the hospital for managements (tests for glucose management, liver function, renal function, HCO3 levels, airway patency)
- odontogenic infections cause an acidic environment in the body
- touching the swelling hurts because there's inflammation and tissue irritation, the other tissues such as the pharynx and larynx also can be irritated; 
- pus going into the mediastinum (location of major blood vessels and heart)  is very dangerous 
- you have to palpate the patient in order to determine how far widespread is the infection - cheek, chin, neck, chest, 

## Ludwig's Angina
- 5 spaces involved
- 2 sublingual
- 2 submandibular
- 1 submental 

## Lymphatic Drainage
- normally no enlargement due to odontogenic infections because it's an acute infection 
- if it's a chronic odontogenic infection, it'll present as a vestibular fistula 

Spaces involved in the odontgenic infections 
53% submandibular space 
multiple spaces: 31%
pterygomandibular space - 22%
submental 17.6%
Submasseteric
sublingual 
buccal 
infratemporal
infraorbital

#journal/surgery
- [ ] epidemiological analysis of management of severe odontogenic infections before referral to the mergency department; katoumas

buccal vs Submandibular differentiation: - palpate; if past the inferior border of mandible = submandibular >>> send to hospital 

Infection course
- inoculation - little cavity on premolar (first contact between bacteria and body)
- celluitis
- abcess
- resolution 

Takes 3 days for antibiotics to work; so in between those times, there could already be spread of infeciton to different spaces 

Radicular cyst - most common cyst

penicilin
cephalosproin
ertap

metronidazole - antiparasitic 

Clindamycin

erythromycin

Criteria to determine severity of infection:
Duration > pain > borders > size > color > consistency > **secretions** > bacteria > risk > duration

## Inoculation 
Criteria: 
- 0-3 days 
- Pain + 
- Localization: Difuse
- size: not big difference but little change 
- normal to erythema 
- consistency 
- secretion - 
- bacteria 
- risk +

every patient with a retained root = inoculation 
endotracheal tube - vehicle to transport bacteria to lower airway = inoculation 

Don't touch anything after putting on gloves before extraction: lights, waist, laptop
## Cellulitis
- 1-5 days 
- Pain ++++
- diffuse 
- size ++
- erythema 
- consistency - indurated 
- secretions - 
- bacteria 
- risk ++ 

- NO PUS (in abcess there's pus - MAIN DIFFERENCE)

Extract first molar, antibiotics, nsaids 
- yes, anesthesia might not work so you give them sodium bicarbonate
- inject 1/3rd, replace 1/3rd with sodium bicarbonate, then inject as normal 
- the sodium bicarbonate will increase the pH 

nosocomial pneumonia - most common infection, esp if they have an endotracheal tube; especially if they have comorbidities - diabetes, hypertension 

Langer Line's (cleavage lines, relaxed skin tension lines) - incision guidelines - parallel to direction of collagen fibers and underlying muscle fibers; 
drainage placed in involved space; need to know anatomy to prevent damaging underlying structures 

infratemporal, deep temporal, buccal, submandibular, pretracheal, retropharyngeal

## Abcess 
- 4-10 days 
- Pain ++ 
- Localized 
- Size ++ 
- Shiny - white
- Consistency - fluctuant 
- Secretions +++
- Bacteria - most anaerobic 
- Risk +++ (riskier than cellulitis)

Complications
- cellulitis 
- osteitis
- osteomyelitis
- necrosis
- sepsis
- septic shock 

Ludwig angina 
- elevated floor of mouth causing tongue to be out of mouth 
- [ ] proptosis of tongue (tongue out)

Alveolar osteitis 
- dry socket 

Osteomyelitis 
- hardest infection to treat 
- several weeks of IV treatment; remove soft tissue and bone 

Necrotizing fasciitis 
- differential diagnosis 

Cavernous sinus thrombosis 
- vessels in mid-third of face 
- pterygomandibular fossa - plexus/veins and can go upward into cavernous sinus; causing clot and can become thrombosed into brain 

Sepsis 
- "Life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host respons to infection"

Septic shock 
- "generalized tissue hypoperfusion syndrome due to sepsis"

Scales - to determine risk of patient to die; no need to memorize 

- SOFA 
	- Criteria used:
respiration
coagulation
liver (bilibrubin)
Cardiovascular (with ekg)
Central nervous system - glascow comma scale 
renal (urine output)
- SOFA
	- glasgow
	- etc.
- NEWS
	- respiration rate
	- spoo2
	- air or oxygen
	- systolic BP

Imaging suppport techniques to determine location of infection 
- PET 
- MRI (IRM - espanol)d
- **CT**  (TC - espanol)
- **OPG** (orthopantamogram)
- **PA** 

CT image #2 
- compression of airway
- sibilance - wheezing
- dyspnea 
- dysphagia 
- can see if infection is in face or neck 
- in neck, more dangerous 
- in face - mostly bone; 

CBCT
