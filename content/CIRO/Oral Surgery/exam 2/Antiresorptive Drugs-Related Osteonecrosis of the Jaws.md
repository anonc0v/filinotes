# Action Items
- [ ] metastasis moa in relation to ADROJ
# Antiresorptive Drugs-Related Osteonecrosis of the Jaws

Exposure of mandibular or maxillary bone that persists for more than 8 weeks in a patient with a history of ingestion of antiresorptive drugs and who has no history of radiotherapy in the craniocervical resion 

- JOMS Marx Stern 2003 - Pamdrionate and zoledronate induced avascular necrosis of the jaws. 

- First report describes that all patients with this lesion were being medicated with pamidronate (aredia, novartis) to control metastasis of tumors 
- they deny that their drugs were the etiology of this lesions, arguing that they run tests in animals in 3600 samples and none of those were showing this outcome - Novartis 
- After this review Dr. Peter Terrassoff (Novartis medical director) request for a formal apology due to the accusations against their drugs 

- 100 years before "Phossy Jaw" - had necrotic bone area in jaws of people who worked in phosphate mines 

Indications:
Paget disease
[[Osteoporosis]] 
bone metastases 

How it works
- inhibits the bone resorption by eliminating the bone remodeling and renewal by irreversible inhibition or osteoclast death
	- osteoclasts - destroy bone 
	- osteocyte - mineralize bone 
- The osteocyte its not an immortal cell, so eventually dies leaving behind zones of dead bone 
	- if these areas are in the mouth, these necrotic areas will be exposed since there wont be a periosteum that nourishes the overlying epithelium 
- the osteocyte function its not the bony formation, but helps to the mineralization of the bone matrix, causing an hypermineralization 

ph 1 - bone demineralizes 
when the osteoclast. eats the bone (infused with bisphosphonates) they will die 
if osteocytes are creating/mineralizing bone and we done have the osteoclasts, the bone will become more dense 

Accion entre osteoclasto y osteblasto 
- presentan un rol dependiente de retroalimentacion estiumlante e ihbitoria 
- osteoblasts activate osteoclasts through RANK receptors; so Osteoblasts send RANK to the RANK receptors on osteoclasts to activate osteoblasts.  The bisphosphonates mimic RANK so osteoclasts get confused and starts to eat the bone.

Bisphosphonates

Metastasis 

Clinic
- bone exposure can happen spontenously or after a surgical event (even after placement of retraction cord!)
- necrotic bone area 
- considered just a clinical finding of bone exposure that never healed and when tries to debride it just became a large region of bone exposure 

Why does it happen just in jaws?
- just in jaws because in alveolar process it has faster rate of remodeling, so the effect of bisphosphonates is compounded since it halts remodeling in an area with a fast rate of remodeling. 

**Soft clinical findings** = findings in Radiograph
- hypermineralized lamina dura 
- increased PDL space 

classification of osteonecrosis
Stage 0 - subclinical damage of the soft tissue due to radiation > "3 H": Hypocellular, hypovascularity and Hypoxic 
Stage 1a - Bone exposure less than 1cm, painless
stage 1b - bone exposure >1cm, Painless 
Stage IIa - bone exposure < 2cm + Pain/infeciton 
Stage IIb - >2cm + Pain/infection
STage IIIa - multiple areas of bone exposure without orocutaneous fistula or pathological fracture 
Stage IIIb - bone exposure >3cm, multiple areas of bone exposure, osteolysis, orocuteanous fistula or pathological fracture 

Estudio de Laboratorio 
- ask for CTX (terminal C telopeptide)
- se puede realizar el estudio de marcadores seircos de remodelado oseo CTX que se libera durante la reabsorcion por osteoclastos 
- <100 pg/mL alto riesgo de desarrollo  - <span style="color:rgb(250, 0, 0)">high risk</span>
- 100 - 150 pg/mL asociado a riesgo moderado  - <span style="color:rgb(255, 255, 0)">medium risk</span> 
- 150 pg/mL - se asocia a riesgo minimo de desarrolllo - <span style="color:rgb(193, 225, 193)">low risk</span> 

20-25mm to reach area you want to anes from soft tissue 
	- this is why you use long needle- rule in medicine is when you are injecting, you want to see a part of the needle 
		- why? - if patient moves, and the needle is fully embedded >>> surgery
			- if patient moves and you use a long needle, you just use mosquito hemostat to remove 
- you'll see half needle when you are at sweet spot
	- if you see more than half, you are too far anterior 
	- if you see less than half, you may be too far posterior
- 1.5mL for blocking
	- lingual nerve will be anesthetized when you block the IAN
	- mylohyoid nerve will also be anesthetized
