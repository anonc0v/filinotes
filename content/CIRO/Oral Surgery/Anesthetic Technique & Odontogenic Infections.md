# Action Items - Odontogenic Infections
 - [ ] 3rd edition Peterson has ODONTOGENIC INFECTIONS
 - [ ] boundaries - cube: anterior 
# Anesthesia 

1.8mL x 2% = 36mg
Max dosage of Lidocaine = 500mg
500 / 36 = 13.8 carpules max 

do not pass 4 cartridges in patients with cardiovascular problems
stop procedure after 86 (diastolic)

Commonly used ocal anesthetics
onset, duration of action, pka, maximum dosage table 3-3

duration of action soft tissue/ pulp max dosage lidocatine tissue: 3-5 hrs soft tissue / 60 min pulp; wait 2-3 min
articaine: 3-6 hours/ 60 min pulp; wait 5-8 min

as you insert, the needle may deviate from a straight path 

long needls: 30-35mm; avg 32mm
Short needls: 20-25mm; avg 20mm
Extra corta solo 30g

Complicaciones
- no doblar la aguja
- no cambiar de direccion una vez insertada
- no tratar de vencer la presion al insertar la aguja 

Dangerous to take needle there b/c there's carotid artery

Anesthetic components:
allergic reaction: meta bisulfito sodico (meta bisulfate sodium) - antioxidant

Problemas
- burbujas en el cartucho (bubbles in cartridge)
- tapon sobresaliente
- quemazon a la inyeccion
- tapon pegajoso
- capuchon corroido 
- capuchon corroido 
- oxido en el capuchon 
- fugas durante la inyeccion
- cartucho roto 

Tecnica supraperiostica 
- se recomienda aguja corta 27G 
- Punto de inyeccion: Pliegue mucobucal por encima de la region apical del diente

- pain is caused by the expansion of tissue by the anesthesia 

Bloqueo palatino anterior (Mayor)
- se recomendia utilizar aguja corta 27G / 30G
- aplicar presion en la zone a infiltrar/ anestesia topica 
- make 3 lines; at intersection; mucogingival junction?, midline, 
- put 1/3rd cartridge only 

Bloqeuo del nervio nasopalatino
- se recomienda utilizar aguja corta 27g?30G
- aplicar presion en la zona a infiltrar / anestesia topica 
- enter from side of incisive papilla at the horizontal line from canine 
- once there is tissue blancing, stop giving anestesia 

Bloqueo IAN
- lingula
- spicus spine?
- 1cm above cm
- anatomic variations
- 20-25mm to reach area you want to anes from soft tissue 
	- this is why you use long needle- rule in medicine is when you are injecting, you want to see a part of the needle 
		- why? - if patient moves, and the needle is fully embedded >>> surgery
			- if patient moves and you use a long needle, you just use mosquito hemostat to remove 
- you'll see half needle when you are at sweet spot
	- if you see more than half, you are too far anterior 
	- if you see less than half, you may be too far posterior
- 1.5mL for blocking
	- lingual nerve will be anesthetized when you block the IAN
	- mylohyoid nerve will also be anesthetized 
- to if you are working to remove an impacted premolar, then you want to directly anesthetize the lingual nerve then you apply 1/3rd caruple on the lingual distal to the last molar 

Long Buccal Nerve 
- 1/3rd cartridge 
- distal 

# Odontogenic infections 

Triangle:
- pathogens
- host (immunity)
- environment (ph/Nutrition/O2 tension)
-Low Host resistance (diabetes), pathogen-friendly environment (diabetes), and a pathogen of high virulence are seen >>> Infection 
***
# Etiology
- cavities
- periodontal disease
- trauma
- mal praxis
	- not sterilizing instruments 
	- non-aseptic technique 

36-45 years old - largest population with greatest prevalence of odontogenic infections b/c of untreated infections when they were younger; 

parapharyngeal space infections 

Amoxicillin most common antibiotic prescribed 

Treatment consists of surgical treatment and medical-supported treatment 

Pathways of infection 
Path of least resistance - infection will go to the buccal/palatal side depending on how close the plate is 

Amox 500mg e/8hrs for 7 days

take 3 days to work:
Lincosamides
B-lactams

Disemination
Buccinator muscle attachment is higher or lower than the root

# Fascial spaces
- latent spaces **CREATED** by distention of tissues secondary to infection of the dental pupl, periodontal tissues and bone, where the infection perforates the cortical plate and discharge into the surrounding spaces 
- bounded by anatomical barriers usually of bone, muscle or fascial layers 

Buccal spaces 
- Superior border 
- inferior border 
- anterior 
- posterior 
- lateral
- medial
