- Pell and Gregory classification of 3rd molar impaction

- Hand washing

**chlorhex** **digluconate 4%**

**povidonie iodine 7.5%**

**ammonium bromide 1%**

3. Impacted teeth treatment- exposure, extraction, traction, observation

4. Most common problem caused by impacted teeth: Pericoronitis 

5. Impacted teeth have <3% chance of developing into cyst/tumor after 40 years old

6. Signs of intimacy of Nerve to 3rd molar -

Diversion of the path of the canal

Narrowing canal 

Darkening of apical portion of root

White line interruption

Root dilaceration

7. Nerve injury: a) Neuropraxia - slight damage to myelin sheath b) Axonotmesis - damage to axons and myelin sheath without disruption of peri/epineurium c) Neurotmesis - severe disruption of the nerve trunk

8. Bisphosphonates - inhibition of osteoclast function, increase osteoblastic function

9. CTX LAB Value (C-terminanl telopeptide) - bone resorption marker values:

Less 100 pg/ml high risk

100-150 pg/ml moderate risk

More than 150 pg/ml lower risk

10. need to block 8mm of length of tissue 

11.Shock is defined as a state of cellular and tissue hypoxia due to either reduced oxygen delivery, increased oxygen consumption, inadequate oxygen utilization, or a combination of these processes.

12. Bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ) now termed: antiresorptive drugs related ostenocrosis of the jaws 

13. Pleomorphic adenoma - most common benign tumor of salivary glands

14. Basal cell adenoma - parotid - 1-2% of salivary gland tumors

15. Mucoepidermoid carcinoma - most common: parotid and minor salivary gland malignancies (palate

16. Heparin - wait 24 hours after last dose to do surgery; 

17. **Warfarin - reduce until Prothrombin time is 1.5-2.5 the normal (17-35seconds) or INR ≤2.5**

17. Normal Prothrombin time - 11-13seconds

18. Upper 3rd molar anesthesia: Posterior superior alveolar nerve and greater palatine nerve

19. PSAN - aneshtesizes 1-3rd upper molars except the MB root of 1st molar (supplied by MSAN) 

20. Postop instructions for 3rd molar surgeries: 1_3 days of Cold therapy

4th day warm therapy every 6-8hrs.

21. Lidocaine - 90 min pulp anesthesia; 2-3 hours soft tissue anesthesia 

22. Articaine - 90 min pulp anesthesia; 5 hours soft tissue anesthesia 

23. Clinical findings of bisphosphonate therapy: in panoramic: mandible has areas of sclerosis, sequestration, or pathologic fracture; delayed healings or bone exposure is present

24. Hba1c value of ≤7% controlled; >7% uncontrolled

25. Buccal Space boundaries:

Superior: zygomatic arch

Inferior: inferior border of mandible

Lateral: skin and subcutaneous tissue

Medial: **buccinator muscles**

Posterior: anterior of masseteric muscle

Anterior: zygomaticus major and depressor anguli oris 

26. Submandibular space boundary:

Superior: mylhyoid muscle and inferior border of mandible 

Inferior: anterior and posterior bellies of digastric ms.

Lateral: platysma and skin, deep cervical fascia

**Medial: mylohyoid, hyoglossus, styloglossus** 

Posterior: posterior belly of digastric 

Anterior: anterior belly of digastric
