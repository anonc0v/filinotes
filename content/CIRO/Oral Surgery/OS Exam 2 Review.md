**Soft clinical findings** = findings in Radiograph
- hypermineralized lamina dura 
- increased PDL space

MOA of Bisphosphonates: inhibits bone remodeling and renewal by irreversible inhibition or osteoclast death

Accion entre osteoclasto y osteblasto 
- presentan un rol dependiente de retroalimentacion estiumlante e ihbitoria 
- osteoblasts activate osteoclasts through RANK receptors; so Osteoblasts send RANK to the RANK receptors on osteoclasts to activate osteoblasts.  The bisphosphonates mimic RANK so osteoclasts get confused and starts to eat the bone.

Definition of Antiresorptive Drugs-Related Osteonecrosis of the Jaws
- Exposure of mandibular or maxillary bone that persists for more than 8 weeks in a patient with a history of ingestion of antiresorptive drugs and who has no history of radiotherapy in the craniocervical region 

most dangerous complication of odontogenic infection = upper airway blockage 

only patients with prosthetic heart devices will receive antibiotic prophylaxis 

everytime you do a surgical extraction, prescribe antibiotics

Antibiotics in hospital:
in-patient:
ampicillin/sulbactam
clindamycin
penicillin + metronidazole
ceftriaxone
penicillin allergy
clindamycin moxifoxacin
vancomycin + metronidazole 
out-patient
amoxicillin 
clindamycin
azithromycin 
Penicillin allergy 
clindamycin 
azithromycin 
metronidazole 
moxifoxacin 

1st day - surgical treatment 
after 3rd day of abx treatment, you evaluate patient 
10th day (1 week after eval of abx treatment) - evaluate again

drainage isn't to take pus out, it's so that the wound does not close 

How to determine how far widespread is the infection?
- you have to palpate the patient in order to determine how far widespread is the infection - cheek, chin, neck, chest, 
## Ludwig's Angina
- 5 spaces involved
- 2 sublingual
- 2 submandibular
- 1 submental 

During IAN, needle passes through internal pterygoid muscle 

short - 20-25mm 
long needle - 30mm

-70mV + impulso de al menos 15mV
-70mV = resting potential (potencial de reposo)

pH
Normal de los tejidos > 7.4 pH
ph de region inflamada > 5-6 pH

How many mm = 8mm to get a block 

Infection course
- inoculation - little cavity on premolar (first contact between bacteria and body)
- celluitis
- abcess
- resolution 

Effect of epinephrine:
- decreases perfusion of local anesthetic into surrounding tissues, controls hemmorhage, lengthen time of effectivity

Criteria to determine severity of infection: 
Duration > pain > borders > size > color > consistency > **secretions** > bacteria > risk > duration

1.8mL x 2% = 36mg
Max dosage of Lidocaine = 500mg
500 / 36 = 13.8 carpules max 

Cavernous sinus thrombosis 
- Vessels in mid-third of face 
- Pterygomandibular fossa - bacteria can enter the pterygoid venus plexus and can go upward into cavernous sinus; causing clot and can become thrombosed into brain 

## Sepsis  - Life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection

Dry socket treatment:
- not an infection; its a lack of healing
- clot has desmosomal junctions 
- do not curettage dry socket
- just irrigate with saline  and place a cotton ball with a little bit of eugenol in the base of socket (you can also use alvogel..but says not as effective)
- then put large cotton ball with nothing 
- ask patient to come next day and replace cotton ball; irrigate with saline befre
- have paitent come; large cotton with eugenol on tip; it will remove by itself eventually; after 7 days recall 
1st day: irrigation; small eugenol cotton ball; large cotton ball
2nd day: irrigation; small eugenol and large cotton ball
3rd day: irrigation; large cutton ball and it will fall out by itself 
1 week after: check 

# Shock - a state of cellular and tissue hypoxia due to either reduced oxygen delivery, increased oxygen consumption, inadequate oxygen utilization, or a combination of these processes.
*** 
### Fascial spaces
### - latent spaces **CREATED** by distention of tissues secondary to infection of the dental pulp, periodontal tissues and bone, where the infection perforates the cortical plate and discharges into the surrounding spaces 
### - bounded by anatomical barriers usually of bone, muscle or fascial layers
