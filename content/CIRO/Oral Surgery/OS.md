2) Rersonal interview w/ the patient or knowledgeable guardian (CH)
3) Physical examination (Cardiovascular + respiratory) - BP, HR, breathing well
4) Medical tests review and referral for consultation if needed
5) Determination of patient's perioperative risk - ASA I, II, III (only emergency)
6) Thorough explanation of various treatment options if possible
7) Informed consent

Caries is not a diagnosis that is indicated for extraction of 3rd molar
Age is a factor - 56 years old; no need
Ages 15 - 26 years old

when describing: e.g. pathology
Superior, inferior, lateral medial, posterior, anterior
- lateral = superficial

Physical Examination
- Labios - i see an exophytic lesion on the lower left lip.  give preliminary diagnosis; vestibule = vestibulo; mucosa yugal = carillos
- paladar duro
- paladar blando
- pilar anterior faringeo
- piso de boca
- vientre de la lengua
- dorso de la lengua

granulos de fordyce

exosotosis/exophytic lesion on the left - do not state name of lesion until you have a histopathologic study

bigger than normal = hypertrophic; cavernous?

# Surgery Day

## Aseptic Technique
- Mayor vs Minor surgery?
- no boots
- all clinic is gray area

- antiseptic solution for oral cavity; chx gluconate 0.12%
	- povidone iodine solution
- antiseptic solution for perioral disinfection
	- surgical soap
	- iodopovidone solution

perioral region then oral cavity
perioral 
- technique 1: start in middle philtrhum then a swirl
- Technique 2: start in center then straight streaks outward 

Drapes around face and chest of patient;
- protect patient
- if instrument drops, you can just pick it up again

Hand washing
chlorhex digluconate 4%
povidonie iodinng 7.5%
ammonium bromide 1%

Surgical attire
- surgical gown
- sterile gloves

Impacted Teeth
incidence:
grove & lorton 3rd molars > maxillary canine
myrberg 6,000 childrens > 5.4% prevalence
Dachi & Howell 3874 > 0.92% canine impactationn
grandahl 1,418 women > 25 non-third molar impacted teeth
	Mx Canine > Md bicuspids > Mx bicuspids > 2nd molar

Lower left 3rd molar - MOST COMMON
- study where the lower left ramus is 6mm shorter than the right

Primary teeth impactation is quite rare. Mandibular molar
Bianchi & Roccuzzo 10 cases in literature in 20 years

# Impacted Teeth
Etiology
" a tooth than can not, or will not, erupt into its normal functioning position, and is, therefore, pathologic and requires treatment"
treatment - extraction, traction, exposure, observation

systemic factors
- syndromes (cleidocranial dysplasia, down syndrome) > primary retention
- endocrine deficiences (Hypothyroidism, hypopituitarism)
- febrile diseases
- irradiation (leukima - lymphoblastic)
	- petersonns principles of oral & maxillofacial surgery

Local factors
- prolonged diciduous tooth retention
- malposed tooth germs
- arch-length deficiency
- supernumerary teeth
- odontogenic tumors (abnormal eruption path)
- cleft lip and palate (canine most common on the side of the cleft - required bone grafting)

Jacoby labially unerupted mx canine > arch length deficiency.
Palatal position related with extra space available

Bichara "...Presence of the lateral incisor root w/ normal length at the normal time is important to guide th ecanine in a proper eruptive direction"

problems caused by impacted teeth
- malocclusion
- loss of arch length
- migration or loss of neighboring teeth
- periodontal disease
- root resorption of adjacent teeth
- resorption (internal or external) of the impacted tooth
- dentigerous cysts
- odontogenic tumors
- **pericoronitis** - most common

Evaluation
- Clinical inspection
- to identify, diagnose, and treat for canines: Gold standard - CBCT
	- for 3rd molars - not always necessary to use CBCT unless associated with IAN canal

- Third mola rmost common tooth
- - 9 yo Crown Rx finding > 2 years later cusp mineralization
- 14-20 yo > root formation & final position
	- 2/3rd root of canine is formed, then you can extract the 3rd molars

Treatment
- determination of future risk
- <3% chance of developing a cyst/tumor after the age of 40 years old;

complicaitons:
after age of 25: 
dry socket
infection
fracture of mandible
after age 50: fracture

Treatment - Surgical extraction
- symptomatic teeth
- infetction of surrounding tissues
- radiographic evidence of changes
	- cyst formation
	- adjacente teeth resorption
	- root reesorption of impacted teeth

Asymptomatic teeth - factors to consider before treatment
- age
- specfiic prevalence of pathologic conditions
- severity of potential pathology associated w/ impacted teeth
- progression of untreateted conditions
- frequency and severity of potential complications of treatment
- potential patient discomfort
- inconvencience associated with either treatmen tor not treamtnet
- economic consequences of treatment*

Treatment
- exposure - pedo patient; teeth just needs exposure then tooth will erupt by himself
- uprising 
- transplantation
- removal

odontopexy?

Periocoronitis 
- peptoestreptococcus, fusobacterium & bacteroides (porphyromonas).
- operculectomy does not work b/c it will just grow back
- bone cannot be eexposed

PRevention
Cysts annd Tumors
<3% chance of developing cyst after 40 years old

- make window, do marsupialization, suture cyst to gingiva, leaving a hole, wait 3- 6 months for cyst to get smalleer, then you are able to do enucleation (w/ extraction of molar) with less trauma b/c it has shrunk

PReventionn
- root resorption of adjacent teeth
- prevention of jaw fracture
- extremes of age - 88 - bleeding, infection fracture

Signs of intimacy of Nerve to 3rd molar -
	Diversion of the path of the canal
	Darkening of apical portion of root
	white line interruption
	root dilaceration
	canal narrowing


Vit B (complex) e/24hrs x 30 days
Dexamethasone - 1 shot - works for 3 days; 45 hrs
Nucleo CMP Forte - every 8 hours x 15 days

Types of nerve injury                                                                                                                        
a. NEUROPRAXIA - the mildest form of injury and described as slight localized myelin sheath damage without continuity defect                                   
- what you would most probably experience if you undergo odontectomy                                                        
- nerve is still anatomically intact but because of trauma and compression of the nerve, it causes a sensory derangement or temporary paresthesia             |
 b.  AXONOTMESIS - disruption and damage to axons and myelin sheath without disruption of the perineurium or epineurium: still has a chance of healing but less  |
 c. NEUROTMESIS - severe disruption of the nerve trunk which may possibly result to permanent neurosensory defect; chance to become permanent nerve derangement

# Action Items

# OS [[2024-04-12]]
Evaluation
imaging - most common is panoramic; b/c it's what we ask for first 
gold standard - CBCT; esp for impacted canine

Tx for impacted canine:
observation
traction
extrusion
exposure

**Treatment**
Determination of future risk
-odontogenic syst - enucleation, marsupialization
-dentigerous cysts normally dont 
-most teeth assoc.

Just for Dentigerous cyst:
-marsupialization and traction into position for a premolar
-but normally all teeth related to pathology

Symptomatic Teeth
- infection of surrounding tissues - edema, inflammation, keratocyst, 
- Radiographic evidence of changes
	- cyst formation
	- adjacent teeth resorption
	- root resorption of impacted teeth
!SURGERY

Asymptomatic teeth 
- age; 
	- why extract after age 25 the risk of complications increases
- specific rpevalence of pathologic conditions
- severity of potential pathology associated with impacted teeth
	- <3% chance of developing into a cyst 
- progression of untreated conditions
	- affect roots of 2nd molar, arch length deficiency
- frequency and severity of potential complications of treatment 
	- most common: pericoronitis
- potential patient discomfort
- inconvenience associated with either treatment or not treatment
- economic consequences of treatment 
!LEAVE ALONE

Treatment 
- exposure - most common surgical treatment for orthodontic treatment;  maybe traction
- uprising
- transplantation
- removal

Pericoronitis 
- no need to prescribe Antibiotics 
- -prevention

cysts and tumors
- 3%
- <40 yo
- treatment: marsupialization if cyst is very big in order to decrease the size of the lesion
- how it grows:
	- remants of odontogenic cells nourished by surrounding vessels 
	- keeps growing
	-  center of mass no longer nourished and dies 
	- keeps growing; surrounded by a capsule
Prevention
- root resorption of adjacent teeth
- prevention of jaw fracture
- extremes of age

Diversion of path of canal 
darkening of apical portion of root
white line interruption
root dilaceration
canal narrowing

types of nerve injury

Pell & Gregory classification

95% of lower 3rds that are alredy erupted have 2 roots and there's presence of oblique ridge that may prevent good purchase area 

osteotomy - cut bone vs ostectomy - removal of bone

next topic: odontogenic infections

Do not damage:
Lingual nerve is 3-5.8mm away from mandible
1-3mm below

temporabl buccal nerve 
long buccal nerve -closer to cheek and too high so u wont damage it

external oblique line - insertion of buccinator;
b/w external and internal oblique line- superior constrictor muscle

Inferior alveolar nerve 
-Truncular technique ... block?
- gum from premolars
Long buccal nerve - need to anes the gums
-supraperiosteal 
Anes with epinephrine
- lidocaine/articaine 

Can you use epinephrine if px has 145/96?
Yes: - controls hemmorhage, perfusion , potency, lasts longer 

Lidocaine/articaine: 90 min pulp block; 2-3 hrs soft tissue - lidocaine ; 4-6 hrs of soft tissue - articaine 

1.8mL 
need to block 8mm of length of tissue 

magetti; maxillo oral facial surgery book;

Posterior superior alveolar nerve; can use PSA block to extract upper 3rd
-the muscle that can be damaged is buccinator muscle 

fracheesko's boook: surgery book 

Complications:
- bleeding
- stiffness
- swelling
- patient bruising
*** 3 days of cold therapy
*** 4 days of warm therapy 
*** 1 hours every 6-8hours
*** no smoking/ no alcohol/no Hot liquids/

Infection : 24-72 hours
fracture*
alveolar osteitis (dry socket) - presents after 24 hours
nerve disturbances 

Rare complications 
- displacement to infratemporal fossa
- displacement to maxillary sinus - amoxicillin/clavulanic acid + loratidine q 8 hours; sterimor 
- displacement to pterygoid space
- mandibular fracture - wrap head with bandage under neck above head and send to hospital 
- displacement to submandibular space 

Dry socket treatment:
- not an infection; its a lack of healing
- clot has desmosomal junctions 
- do not currettage dry socket
- just irrigate with saline  and place a cotton ball with a little bit of eugenol in the base of sockett (you can also use alvogel..but says not as effective)
- then put large cotton ball with nothing 
- ask patient to come next day and replace cottton ball; irrigate with saline befre
- have paient come; large cotton with eugenol on tip; it will remove by itself eventually; after 7 days recall 
1st day: irrigation; small eugenol cotton ball; large cotton ball
2nd day: irrigation; small eugenol and large cotton ball
3rd day: irrigation; large cutton ball and it will fall out by itself 
1 week after: check 

No improvement seen until 72 hours
