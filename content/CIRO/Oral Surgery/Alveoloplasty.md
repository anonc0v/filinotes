1. **Anesthesia:** Circumferential local infiltration; included sites are on either side of the flap on the residual ridge, 2 more sites towards in the vestibular area evenly spaced within the area in need of alveoloplasty
    
2. **Incision:** Using blade #5, make an atraumatic incision through the mucosa (soft tissue lining) and periosteum (thin layer covering the bone) on the residual crest.  The incision must be wide enough to encompass the area of surgery in order to prevent tissue tearing and to allow enough access to the surgical site.
    
3. **Tissue Elevation:** Using MPE molt #5, reflect a full-thickness flap to expose the area in need of alveoloplasty.
    
4. **Alevoloplasty:** Rongeur and Bone file will be used to remove bony undercuts, sharp protruberances, and irregular bone.  If a bone bur in handpiece is used, copious irrigation will be used to prevent overheating of bone, which will result in necrosis and increased bone resorption.  Copious irrigation will be needed to flush the surgical site of any fragments of bone.
    
5. **Closure:** Interrupted sutures approximated in the area with enough tension will be used to close the incision and promote proper healing of the soft tissues.
