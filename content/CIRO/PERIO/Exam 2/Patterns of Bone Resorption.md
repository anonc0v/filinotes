# Patterns of Bone Resorption 

## objective of periodontal treatmnet
- eliminate the inflammation to suppress resorption stimulus to allow the regeneration and bone apposition 
*** 
- Local and systemic factors >>> bone resorption and apposition >>> bone height and density 
*** 
The amount of bone loss is not always related to:
- level of gingival inflammation 
- dental plaque
- presence or absence of pus
- ulcerations on the pocket wall
*** 
Gingivitis always happens before periodontitis but not all gingivitis develop PD
Chronic inflammation {plaque composition, host response, cellular composition of the CT} = PD
*** 
## histopathology
- inflammation extends through collagen fibers following blood vessels 
- from gingiva to bone, inflammation destroys:
	- gingival fibers 
	- periodontal fibers 
- in bone, inflammation extends through marrow spaces  
*** 
- internal resorption >>> thinning of the bone >>> expansion to marrow spaces >>> bone resorption and loss of bone height 
*** 
- Transseptal fibers regeneration and are ALWAYS present no matter how severe the PD 
- bone loss is not because of necrosis, it's due to remodeling 
- in cases of necrosis, suppuration comes from the internal wall of the pocket 
*** 
- plaque ratio (radius) of action: 1.5-2.5mm 
- bone destruction is intermittent 
- has periods of inactivity 
*** 
## Mechanisms of bone destruction 
- bone destruction is mediated by bacteria and host response 
- bacterial products induce  differentiation of cells into osteoclasts 
- *in PD bacteria is found between collagen fibers and over bone surface = direct effect*  - main way 

- Exacerbation and remission match with 
	- degree of inflammation 
	- amount of bleeding 
	- plaque composition 
		- no point in knowing the exact composition b/c we have products like chlorhexidine or broad-spectrum antibiotics that can act as an adjunct to mechanical methods of plaque elimination
	- amount of exudate 

## Bone destruction by trauma of occlusion 
- it can cause bone loss with or without inflammation 
- Without inflammation: 
	- compression and widening of the PL
	- increase of osteoclasts activity 
	- periodontal ligament space >>> widening 
	- bone and/or root resorption 
- With inflammation:
	- increases bone loss 
	- generates bone defects in different patterns - crater defects (generation seen in lone teeth due to forces the tooth experiences all around) 
# Factors that determine bone morphology in PD

## Anatomical characteristics that modifies bone patterns 
- thickness, width and angulation of bone crests 
- thickness of vestibular and lingual of bone corticals - like canines, thin buccal bone so you see large recessions
- presence of fenestrations and/or dehiscence 
- teeth alignment 
- Radicular shape 
- root position in the socket 
- proximity to adjacent teeth 
	- too close: esthetics compromised: papilla, interdental bone; no interdental bone, no papilla 
	- too far: esthetics compromised because flat papilla, flat interdental bone 

- Angular defects do not form in thin vestibular or lingual corticals with little spongy bone >>> total destruction >> loss of bone height 
- the more spongy bone, the more destruction 
- thicker buccal cortical plate, more chance of developing vertical defects 

## Exostosis 
- bony protuberances with different shape and size 
- the most common are the mandibular ones 
- 40% of the cases are palatal which can be small nodules, in crest shape or combinations

## Trauma of oclussion 
can cause:
	- alterations in the morphology 
	- angular defects of crater shape defects 
	- thickening of the bone cervical margin 

## food impaction 
- because of abnormal interproximal spaces 
	- vertical defects can occur within months due to iatrogenic causes, such as with open contacts
- the contact point is modified or doesn't exist 
- mainly because bad restorations or crowns 
- food irritation and pressure complicates the defect but are not the cause 

## Vertical defects 
- also named **infrabony** defects
- from the tip of the alveolar crest to the depth of the defect 
- based on the # bone walls 
- increased with age 
- only through surgery we see it's real shape 
- allows bone regeneration 

## Horizontal defects 
- the most common type 
- can be on different levels around the tooth 
- affects interproximal spaces - because bone is thinner, and this is where food can get stuck (below contact point)
- not suitable for bone regeneration 
- in xrays - can tell if its perio or not bc in perio, you'll see "cup-like" shape defects with no cortical bone present on the crest (aka lamina dura); in healthy bone, presence of lamina dura/cortical bone on crest

extrusion (ortho - wire/rubber bands): can regeneration bone and soft tissues w/o surgery 

on the OSCE exam, if theres calculus or a radiolucency on a radiograph indicating caries, you can't say it's caries or calculus because it needs clinical confirmation (ONLY ON EXAM OSCE)

One wall defect - 1 wall remaining
Two Wall defect - 2 walls remaining 
Three wall defect - 3 walls remaining
Crater defects - no bone on coronal section 

Sub-classification 
A, B, C 

all can be bone grafted but best with 3 wall defect 

E: except; higher composition of water 

#op/class 
Lingual - parallel/90 degree 
buccal - convergent 

External Outline Form
- outline shape/ continuity/extension
- proximal clearance
- gingival clearance
- isthmus
- cavosurface margin 
- sound marginal tooth structure 

Internal form
- axial wall 
- pulpal floor 
- caries/remaining 
- retention
- proximal walls
