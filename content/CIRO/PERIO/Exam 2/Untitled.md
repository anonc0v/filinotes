distal canine and mesial of 2nd molar = donor site 
3mm thickness of palate (including graft; normally graft will be 1-1.5mm thick if thickness is 3mm in palate as measured with probe)
leave 2mm from the cervical section, so we normally have 5mm to work with b/w the 2mm zone and where the artery is (7-12mm away from cervical of teeth)

-pocket - no releasing incision necessary
- more difficult technique 
- less discomfort to the patient less visibility

Tunnel Technique 
- for multiple recessions
- depends on the size of the graft 
- for narrow, short recessions 
- preferred in thick biotypes 

Full Thickness "tunnel flap"
- go beyond MCJ so you can pull the tissue
- tunnel because interdental papillas are not released 
- need special microsurgical instruments
- ideal for wide, thick papillas so that you can manipulate the tissues without tearing 
- the more keratinized tissue you have, the more difficult 
- then you pull the connective tissue through; ideally CT needs to be covered by a flap.

Free Gingival Graft 
- also taken from palate 
- from the same site 
- take the epithelium, not the CT
- "it is the removal of masticatory mucosa from a donor area to a new location in the mouth"
- until the 80s it was the most used technique 
- specially used to create attached gingiva 
- also called onlay graft 
	- onlay bc you can just leave it exposed just suture it on the site you want 
- nabers modified the technique: deepening of the vestibule 

ADvantages
- creates attached gingiva 
- suitable for multiple teeth 
- easy technique - b/c its taken from external surface and doesn't required a flap on the recipient site
- in case of pathoologic frenum 
- also used for root coverage 
- the ONLY technique that creates keratinized tissue/attached gingiva 

Disadvantages 
- requires two surgical areas 
- pain in the donor site 
- difficult blood supply 
- color and shape abnormalities 
	- grafted tissue looks lighter than surrounding tissues 

Indications
- to improve width of attached gingiva 
- to create keratinized tissue 
- for vestibule deepening 
- for radicular recessions 
- for ridge augmentation 
- to eliminate abnormal frenum 

Intraoral donor areas 
- palate (the most common) 
	- from distal of canine to mesial of 2nd molar 
	- if patient is edentulous, you can take tissue from the ridge 

Requirement for graft surgery 
- blood supply 
	- following principle for flaps and grafts 
	- avoid clots under the graft = necrosis 
	- periosteum 
		- for blood supply 
		- for stitches
		- support 
	- survies through plasmatic circulation
	- you need it in direct contact with the underlying periosteum so you want it stitched well
	- the overlying surface will be white because the blood cannot reach the outer surface (it is necrotic tissue, it can smell too); it will take 2 weeks to 21 days to reach the external surface at which point reepithelialization lization will take place.
- graft stability
	- sutures used 
	- design of stitches 
	- pressure over the graft 
	- also obtained with: surgical dressing and/or pressure 
		- surgical dressings not used much (coepack)
	
nylon - maintains tension, nonresorbale, clean suture; attaches less plaque and less food
suspensory stitch - uses tooth as a support; deeper tissues (periosteum) can be used as anchor points for stitches

Healing of the donor area 
- donor areas heals practically the same as any injury 
- thin grafts (1-1.25mm thick), takes 14-21 days 
- final healing after 3 months approx 

Important factors for graft stability 
- thickness of underlying bone 
- distance from bone to gingival margin 
- width of attached gingiva 
	- ideally 5mm: 2gingival culcus and 3 attached gingiva 
- presence of subgingival restorationa = chronic inflammation 

Healing time
- implants: after a year in abscence of inflammation is considered stable 
- implants 
	- position of implant in the arch 
	- frenum (risk of retraction) 
	- characteristics of the implant 
		- width 
		- length 
		- special shape 

a) correct amount of attached gingiva (5mm or more)
b) attached gingiva only on the edge of the ridge 
c) only a small amount of attached gingiva on palatal or lingual 

Seibert's Ridge classification (1983)
- I - height, no width 
- II - width, no height 
- III - no height and no width 

Initial phase of healing 
- plasmatic circulation (leftovers) keeps graft surviing for the first few days 
Revascularization phase (2-11 days)
- 4-5 days there is anastomosis between graft and tissues  (CT)
- blood supply is reestablished 
- the upper layers of the graft get necrotized 
- contraction occurs most evident on the borders of graft where the sutures are placed 
Tissues maturation (11-42 days)
- at day 14 the graft's vascular system appears normal 
- keratinization continues 
- keeps good blood supply 
- avoid tissue injuries (traumatic brushing, eating) 
- scars may be present due to contraction of wound/graft 
	- after healing, you can deepithelize with electrosurgery or burs 

Partial thickness flap 
- initial incision at mgj 
- can leave it with stitches at deepest portion 
- flap sutured to periosteum
