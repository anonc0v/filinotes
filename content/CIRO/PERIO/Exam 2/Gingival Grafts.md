## Causes of recession
- periodontal disease
- buccal migration of teeth
- dehiscence because of trauma
	- most cases are natural
- ortho movements
- traumatic brushing
- bad habits

## important factors for root coverage
- level of the recession (if it goes beyond the MGL)
- Presence or absence of interproximal bone 
- presence of papilla
- the extension of the malposition of the tooth 

## options for root coverage 
- pedunculated gingival flap
	- e.g. coronally advanced flap
	- flaps you can twist/move
- Free gingival grafts 
- Connective tissue grafts 
- CT grafts especially for wide and deep defects

## Recession Classifications
- Miller's (1997-2017)
	- Class I - does not reach MGL, no interdental bone loss; expect 100% root coverage 
	- Class II - reaches MGL or beyond, no interdental bone loss/soft tissue loss; expect 80-85% root coverage
	- Class III - reaches MGL or beyond, with interdental bone loss/papilla loss; 45% root coverage
	- Class IV - reaches MGL or beyond, with severe interdental bone loss; root coverage not expected; ≤45% root coverage 
- Cairo's (2017 - current) - focus on interdental bone and soft tissue loss 
	- Class I
		- GR with no interdental attachment loss. the interdental CEJ is not detectable clinically (miller Class I and II GR)
	- Class II
		- GR with an interdental attachmen tloss. The amount of the interdental attachment loss is lesss than or equal to the oral attachment loss (mid-buccal bone loss) (miller class III GR).
		- 
	- Class III
		- GR with an interdental attachment loss.  The amount of the interdental attachment loss is higher than the oral attachment loss (Miller Class IV GR)


## Etiological factors of gingival recession 
- anatomical factors 
	- thin periodontal phenotype (no longer biotype)
	- abnormal tooth position
	- high frenum attachments
- pathological factors 
	- periodontal disease 
	- bacterial plaque 
	- dental calculus 
- Traumatic factors 
	- toothbrushing 
	- flossing trauma 
- Iatrogenic factors 
	- orthodontic movement 
	- prosthetic and restorative treatment 

Defect-related factors 
- recession classification 
- recession size 
- adjacent papilla dimension 
- keratinized tissue 
- noncarious cervical lesions 
- tooth malposition and tooth location 
Patient-related factors 
- plaque control 
- toothbrushing 
- tobacco smoking 
Operator-related factors 
- surgical skills 

Abraction
- must be ≤2mm if you want to restore with tissue graft (may trim/make smooth before placing graft)
- if more than 2, need to restore before grafting because if you place graft, there'll be a dead space with no underlying blood supply, and the tissue will recede again in order to find a stable location
