# Action Items

# Chemical Plaque Control
- Good chemical agent = 80% inhibition of plaque 
- the only one to do this is [[1. PROJECTS/Dentistry/Dental Materials/Chlorhexidine]] 

## Effect of Chemical Plaque Control 
1. Anti-adhesives
2. Antimicrobial
3. Plaque eliminators
4. Anti-pathogenics

### 1. Anti-adhesives 
- acts over the superficial pellicle to avoid initial bacterial adhesion/fixation
- Disadvantage:
	- too toxic to be used in the mouth
	- inefficient over dental plaque
### 2. Anti-microbial
Inihbits plaque through 2 mechanisms
1. **Bacteriostatic** - **Inhibition of bacterial proliferation** (primary bacteria)
2. **Bactericidal** - Destruction of MOs 
	1. most pellicles are resistant to the bactericidal effect 
	2. this is why best after a professional cleaning and/or toothbrushing 
	3. no product STERILIZES the tooth surface 
	4. disadvantage: destroys healthy or "useful" bacteria 

### 3. Plaque eliminators 
- acts as a dental brush
- reaches all surfaces 
- suggestions: hypochlorite solutions (too toxic)

### 4. Anti-pathogenic 
- eliminate pathogenic expression of bacteria 
- no advances in research

# Vehicles for administration of chemical agents 

## 1. Dentrifices
### Main Ingredients
1. Abrasives
	1. dicalcic phosphate, calcium carbonate
	2. they help to control extrinsic stains
2. Detergents

		1. foam formation
3. Sweeteners
	1. Saccharine
4. Thickeners
	1. Silica
5. Humectants
	1. glycerin and sorbital
	2. prevents dehydration of paste once opened
6. Flavors
7. Active Agents
	1. [[1. PROJECTS/Dentistry/Dental Materials/Fluoride|Fluoride]]

## [[1. PROJECTS/Dentistry/Dental Materials/Chlorhexidine]] 
- Chemical structure: Diguanidohexane
- contains **12% alcohol** 
- 10mL of 0.2% inhibits 
	- plaque 
	- calculus
	- gingivitis 
- Reversible effects
	- brown-staining 
		- teeth
		- tongue
		- resins
