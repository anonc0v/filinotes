# Action Items

# Chemical Plaque Control
- Good chemical agent = 80% inhibition of plaque 
- the only one to do this is [[1. PROJECTS/Dentistry/Dental Materials/Chlorhexidine]] 

## Effect of Chemical Plaque Control 
1. Anti-adhesives
2. Antimicrobial
3. Plaque eliminators
4. Anti-pathogenics

### 1. Anti-adhesives 
- acts over the superficial pellicle to avoid initial bacterial adhesion/fixation
- Disadvantage:
	- too toxic to be used in the mouth
	- inefficient over dental plaque
### 2. Anti-microbial
Inihbits plaque through 2 mechanisms
1. **Bacteriostatic** - **Inhibition of bacterial proliferation** (primary bacteria)
2. **Bactericidal** - Destruction of MOs 
	1. most pellicles are resistant to the bactericidal effect 
	2. this is why best after a professional cleaning and/or toothbrushing 
	3. no product STERILIZES the tooth surface 
	4. disadvantage: destroys healthy or "useful" bacteria 

### 3. Plaque eliminators 
- acts as a dental brush
- reaches all surfaces 
- suggestions: hypochlorite solutions (too toxic)

### 4. Anti-pathogenic 
- eliminate pathogenic expression of bacteria 
- no advances in research

# Vehicles for administration of chemical agents 

## 1. Dentrifices
### Main Ingredients
1. Abrasives
	1. dicalcic phosphate, calcium carbonate
	2. they help to control extrinsic stains
2. Detergents
	1. sodium lauryl-sulfate
		1. foam formation
3. Sweeteners
	1. Saccharine
4. Thickeners
	1. Silica
5. Humectants
	1. glycerin and sorbital
	2. prevents dehydration of paste once opened
6. Flavors
7. Active Agents
	1. [[1. PROJECTS/Dentistry/Dental Materials/Fluoride|Fluoride]]
## 2. Mouthwashes
- alcohol improves shelf life
- Most contain â‰¤10% alcohol 
- relationship b/w alcohol and oral cancer has not been established
![[assets/Perio mouthwash Oral-B.png|300]]
## 3. Spray 
- may target specific area 
- as effective as mouthwashes 
- useful for elderly/disabled 
- stain teeth and tongue as much as mouthwashes

![[assets/Perio Mouthwash Cetylpridinium chlroide.png]]
## [[1. PROJECTS/Dentistry/Dental Materials/Chlorhexidine]] 
- Chemical structure: Diguanidohexane
- contains **12% alcohol** 
- 10mL of 0.2% inhibits 
	- plaque 
	- calculus
	- gingivitis 
- Reversible effects
	- brown-staining 
		- teeth
		- tongue
		- resins 

[[1. PROJECTS/Dentistry/Dental Materials/Chlorhexidine]]  Brand names:
1. Bexident EncÃ­as Colutorio (0.20%)
2. Perioxidin
![[assets/Perio mouthwash and gel perioxoidin.png|300]]
3. Oral-B Gingivitis 
4. KIN gingival
	1. ![[assets/Perio mouthwash kin.png|200]]
5. Periogard (Colgate)
![[assets/Perio perioguard.png|200]]

## Directions for Mouthwash 
- twice a day 
- no dilution 
- 1. Brush 
- 2. Wait 15-20 minutes 
- 3. Mouthwash 
- 4. 10-15 minutes without eating or drinking 

Characteristics for Plaque Control 
- agent must have **SUBSTANTIVITY**
	- capcity to remain active for a period of time
- antimicrobial activity againt primary colony former
- Minimum neutralization by bacteria and their products 

## Chlorhexidine 
- 1970 Loe y Schiott - 10mL of CHSX for 0.2% for 60s results in plaque inhibition 

### Mechanism of action 
- powerful anti-MO power 
- **substantivity**
	- **bacteriostatic** effect last 12 hours
	- binds strongly to plasma membrane of bacteria 
- **Bactericidal**: causes precipitation of cytoplasm
- slow-release from teeth surfaces 
### Toxicity, Safety, and secundary effects 
- not well-abosrbed by skin, mucosa and digestive tract
- not teratogenic
- no gastric effects
- Effective against gram + and gram - bacteria 
- Effective against yeasts, fungi (candida) and viruses (HIV and HBV)
- no reports of bacterial resistance and does not cause fungal opportunistic infection (Candida)

### Side-effects
1. Brown staining of teeth, tongue, restoration material 
2. Taste alterations (decrease in salty taste)
3. Erosion of oral mucosa (dose-dependent)
4. Unilateral/bilateral sweilling of parotid gland
5. Bitter taste
