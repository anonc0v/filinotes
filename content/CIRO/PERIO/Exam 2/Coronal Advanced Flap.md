# Action Items

# Coronal Advanced Flap

## Indications
- for prosthetic reasons for small-moderate recessions
- coverage of membrane in cases of regeneration 

## Limitations
- absence of keratinized tissue
- loss of interdental tissue (soft and hard)
- deep cervical caries 

>[!tip] advantages over lateral flaps 
>- Need less donor tissue 
>-  Work with more teeth
>- Doesn't expose periosteum - less risk in relation to esthetics 

## Advantages 
- good aesthetic results 
- minimum pain for the patient 
- simple technique 
- fast recovery (healing)

## Disadvantages
- do not increase attached gingiva 
- decrease of the vestibule depth 
- can have a reincidence 

You can use FT (full-thickness) flap all the way.
New literature, says you do PT, FT, PT for better healing HISTOLOGICALLY.  But clinically, you get the same result.

# Coronal displaced flapy without releasing incisions 
- Zucchelli (2000) - biggest guy on soft tissue 
- For multiple recessions (short ones)
- can be combined with a sub-epithelial connective tissue graft (SECTG)
- less discomfort to the patient. - same advantages for coronal advanced flap 

Supraperiosteal suture - anchors tissue to underlying periosteum 

# Soft tissues II  - Subepithelial connective tissue graft 

## What is a graft?
- is the transposition of subepithelial connective tissue from a donor site (generally from the palate) to the receptor area 
- operate on donor site 
- operate on receptor site 

>[!tip] Nowadays, you may not need the donor site bc you can just buy it. 

## When do we use SUBepithelial CTG?
- to improve the width of attached gingiva 
- for vestibule deepening 
- to eliminate pathologic frenum 
- to gain attached gingiva
	- aesthetic areas 
	- around implants 
- for root coverage (recessions) 
- furca involvements 
- to correct ridge defects 

The only graft to create new attached gingiva?
- Free Gingival graft 

## Advantages 
- the most predictable soft tissue grafting technique 
- blood supply comes from the receptor area and from the flap 
- suitable for multiple teeth 
- good average of healing and less pain  - be careful of the palatal artery 
- better results in color and appearance in relation with surrounding tissues 
- the donor area is covered with epithelium - less ..... 

## Disadvantages 
- more difficult technique 
- compared with FGG, epithelialization takes longer 
- requires two surgeries 
- two surgical areas (donor and receptor) 
- risk of profuse bleeding if damaging blood vessels (palatal area)

## Limitations 
- thin palate not suitable for grafting (at least 3mm of thickness)
- inadequate scaling and root planing
- graft to thin (at least 1.5 - 2mm of thickness to prevent necrosis) 
- trauma over the graft during healing 
- interproximal bone support 
- perforation of the graft when working 
- inadequate flap coverage of the graft 

>[!tip]
Distal of 2nd molar to distal of canine = ideal donor site 
The palatal ruggae = have the thinnest palatal thickness 
Only need to leave 2mm of keratinized tissue 
palatal artery is on average 7mm away from the distal of the 1st molar ??...

>[!tip]
Surgery #1 - start with recipient site 
> - because once you remove the graft from the recipient site it has no blood supply 

>[!tip] Be Careful of Palatal Artery
Deeper palatal arch - palatal artery is further 
the flatter the palatal arch - palatal artery is closer 
Thickness of palatal - at least 3mm (poke with probe) - the subepi ctg will be 1-1.5mm in this scenario that the palate is 3mm 

When working with lower arch, blood gets stuck. Careful of the mental nerve.

After separating epithelium from the CTG, you take blade and go all the way to bone to separate the CTG that you want so you can retrieve it.

Donor site is more painful than recipient. Because during healing, the wound contracts (even with stitches) and it heals by secondary intention.  You can minimize discomfort by making a nightguard before surgery to prevent the tongue from touching the area 

How to stop bleeding from palatal artery if it is cut? 
- use hemostatic sponges
- stitches (ligature)
- nobody will die from the palatal artery wound 
- local anesthestic (epinephrine)

Graft is sutured to the papillas and around tooth 

ADM = acellular dermal matrix
