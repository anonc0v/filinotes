# PATHOGENESIS
## Microbial dysbiosis - P. Gingivalis
- Lindhe: Clinical Periodontology, p. 215, check highlights

P. gingivalis – a member of the “red complex” of periodontal bacteria, contributes to disease by **altering the normal oral microbiota to a dysbiotic state** (Hajishengallis et al., 2011). These studies demonstrated that the oral commensal microbiota is responsible for the tissue and bone destruction associated with periodontitis when just low numbers of P. gingivalis are present.

This finding helps explain an apparent paradox associated with P. gingivalis being regarded as a key specific agent in periodontal disease when several lines of investigation have demonstrated that this bacterium is not a potent inducer of inflammation (Curtis et al. 2011). For example, as described earlier in this chapter, the LPS of P. gingivalis has an unusually low inflammatory potency and furthermore this bacterium is able to synthesize a lipid A structure that inhibits rather than promotes inflammation through antagonism of one of the innate immune receptors for LPS, Toll‐like receptor 4. This is in stark contrast to the highly inflammatory properties of the LPS pro- duced by most other bacteria and challenges the view that exacerbation of the inflammatory response by P. gingivalis is a driving force in the development of periodontal disease. In addition, P. gingivalis is unu- sual in that it does not induce secretion of interleu- kin‐8 (IL‐8) by gingival epithelial cells, unlike a variety of other oral bacteria. Instead, it actually inhibits the secretion of this potent chemokine for neutrophil recruitment through a phenomenon termed local chemokine paralysis (Darveau et al. 1998). Once again, such an anti‐inflammatory prop- erty, in this case down‐regulation of phagocytic cell trafficking into the periodontium, is contrary to the properties one would anticipate to be a prerequisite of an organism which drives the disease process through up‐regulation of the inflammatory response. These apparent paradoxes can however be explained if periodontitis is viewed as a community disease reliant upon an entire dysfunctional microbiota as opposed to the traditional view of a conventional infectious disease caused by a single, multiple or indeed complexes of periodontal pathogens.

# Oral Mucosa [[2024-02-28]]
1. lining mucosa/movable mucosa/alveolar mucosa - non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelium
2. masticatory mucosa - keratinized stratified squamous epithelium
3. specialized mucosa - keratinized/nonkeratinized stratified squamous epithelium; taste perception; also considered masticatory mucosa

Oral mucosa (divided anatomically)
1. Masticatory mucosa (gingiva and hard palate - everything that is keratinized)
	1. Marginal
		1. Gingival Sulcus
	2. Attached
	3. Interdental
2. Specialized mucosa (dorsum of the tongue)
3. Oral mucous membrane (the rest of oral cavity)

- 2mm of. atttached gingiva at least to maintain gingival health
	- enough to resist trauma, brushing, etc

- mucogingival line - tells what flap you do in periodontal surgery
	- separates the gum from the alveolar mucosa
	- no mucogingival line (junction) in palate

![[perio anatomy structure.png]]


# 1. Masticatory Mucosa
## 1.1 Marginal gingiva
- free/unattached gingiva
- terminal ends of gingiva surrounding teeth in **collar-like fashion**
- about 50% of cases demarcated by a shallow linear depression: free gingival groove
- coral pink or soft pink (in healthy gingiva)
- usually 1-2mm wide
- forms the soft tissue wall of the gingival sulcus
- in clinically healthy gingiva may or may not be gingival sulcus
- may form a psuedopocket, for example in younger patients with braces

## 1.2 Gingival Sulcus
- V-shaped space around tooth bounded by the tooth surface and the inner wall of the marginal gingiva
- in ideal conditions, gingival sulcus is 0mm
- in clinically healthy gingiva, it is 1-3mm deep as measured by a periodontal probe
- histologic depth may not equal the depth of penetration of the probe
- Penetration of probe depends on:
	- probe diameter
	- probing force
	- level of inflammation

## 2. Attached gingiva
- width measured from the bottom of the periodontal pocket to the **mucogingival junction**.
- generally ; 3.5-4.5mm in mx and 3.3-3.9 in md
- 1.9 in mx and 1.8 in md
- When u get older,width of attached gingiva can get thicker, according to some studies
- not equal to width of keratinized (since keratinized would also include marginal gingiva)

![[Perio anatomy attached gingiva.png|500]]

Gingival Phenotype (Biotype)
Biotype before, now it's called phenotype b/c the characteeristics depend with a variety of factors including genetics, underlying bone, shape of teeth, etc

| Gingival Phenotype (Biotype) ~ { "text-align": "center" } | <                                                  |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Thin**                                                  | Thick                                              |
| - Contact point is higher                                 | - Contact point is lower                           |
| - Base of interdental papilla is slimmer                  | - Base of interdental papilla is wider             |
| - Harder to stitch without breaking                       | - Easier to stitch without breaking                |
| - Higher scar risk                                        | - Lower scar risk                                  |
| - Less prominent or not visible gingival groove           | - Gingival groove, when present, is more prominent |
| - Prognosis for tissue replacement is lower               | - Prognosis for tissue replacement is higher       |

## 3. Interdental gingiva
- occupied gingival embrasure 
	- interproximal space below contact point/area
- tapered towards interproximal area
- slightly concave at the mesial and distal surfaces.

![[interdental gingiva.png]]
###  Anterior Interdental Papilla
-  pyramidal shape
- shape determined by
	- contact points of adjacent teeth
	- CEJ shape of each tooth
	- width of dental surfaces
### Posterior Interdental Papilla
- shape: flattened V-L 
- has a contact surface/area rather than a contact point
- forms col
	- valley-like *depression/concavity* that connects the labial/vestibular and palatal/lingual papilla
	- 2 layers 
		a. Stratum basale
		b. Stratum spinosum
- consists of nonkeratinized epithelium
### 5mm rule 
@tarnowEffectDistanceContact1992 
[[@tarnowEffectDistanceContact1992]] #perio/journal
- 5mm b/w contact point and crest of bone there'll be  interdental papilla
	- so if you see black spaces, probably there's something going on with interdental bone - bone loss, bony defect, etc
	- that's why in crowded teeth, there's no interdental papilla bc there's no space for the interdental bone

- 3mm b/w 2 implants vs 1.5mm b/w implant and tooth because... normal tooth has periodontal ligament and implant does not; needs more support
# Oral Epithelium
[[2024-03-06]] 

Stratified squamous epithelium differentiates into 3 types in the oral cavity:
## 1. Oral/Outer epithelium
-  *faces oral cavity*
- covers the crest, the outer surface of the marginal gingiva and attached gingiva
- stratified squamous keratinized epithlium
	- does not have blood veessels
	- 2mm of kreatinized tissues maintains teeth health -normal teeth/teeth with crowns/ with implants (needs more keratinized tissue)
- Variations of keratinization
	- palate - most keratinized
	- gingiva
	- ventral aspect of the tongue
	- cheeks
## 2. Sulcular epithelium
- *faces the tooth without being in contact w/ the enamel*
- nonkeratinized stratified squamous epithelium
	- if you use modified bass technique, the modified base technique stimulates the tissues and you'll have some degree of keratinization in areas where bristles reach
	- after periodontal tissues are healed, you can use stillman and the tissues will return to normal nonkeratinized
- from the coronal portion of the junctional epithelium to the crest of the gingival margin
- it lacks granulosum and corneum stratum
- acts as a semipermeable membrane through which bacterial products pass into the gingiva and tissue fluid to the sulcus.
## 2.1 Crevicular Fluid
- comes from the gingival connective tissue through sulcular epithelium
- it is believed to:
	- cleanse material from the sulcus
	- to contain plasma proteins that may improve adhesion of the epithelium (junctional epithelium) to the tooth
	- possess antimicrobial properties - alllows defense cells to enter sulcus
	- exert antibody activity to defend gingiva

## 3. Junctional epithelium
- *faces tooth and is in contact with tooth (cementum) and gingiva*
- collar-like band of stratified squamous nonkeratinized epithelium attached to tooth surface via hemidesmosomes
- the length ranges from 0.25 to 1.35mm
- constituted by 10 to 20 layers of cells
- its completely restored after instrumentation
- has something similar in implants but its not exactly juntional epithelium; sort of a biological seal
- no Junctional epithelium nor pdl in implants
- attached to the tooth surface by means of an internal basal lamina
- attached to the gingival connective tissue by means of external basal lamina
- connected to tooth by hemidesmosomes - attach the cells to the internal basal lamina on th etooth surface
- attaches to acellular cementum in the crown, usually to the area within 1mm of the CEJ
- calculus has a radius of 3mm of reach of bacteria/toxins; so a tiny calculus will have 3mm ranges
- the attachment of the junctional epithelium to the tooth is reinforced by the gingival fibers
- gingival fibers = brace the marginal gingival against the tooth surface

## Microscopic Anatomy of **Oral Epithelium**


![[Histological-left-and-schematic-right-image-of-the-buccal-oral-mucosa-histological.png]]

- keratinized, stratified squamous epithelium
- From the the lamina propria to the exterior , there are 4 layers
## 4 Layers 
1.  Stratum Basale/Germinativum
	1. cuboidal cells
		1. complete organelles
2. Stratum Spinosum/Prickle Cell layer
	1. Slightly flattened cells
	1. Feature: **cytoplasmic spines**
		1. complete organelles but smaller nucleus
3. Stratum Granulosum 
	1. Cells flatten further
		1. flattened nucleus
		2. loss of organelles
	2. Feature: **Keratohyaline structures** (90% of the cell) ^66e823
4. Stratum Corneum
	1. no more organelles
	2. no more nucleus
		1. possibly remnants of nucleus >>> parakeratinized

>[!success] Keratinization?
>A process that takes place as the keratinocyte matures, **starting** from the *stratum basale* and **ending** at  the *stratum corneum*
> >Takes 21 days
> >>  Healing takes 4-6weeks minimum:
> >>  - Wait **4-6weeks** after SRPs, crown lengthening and graftings (CIRO due to time constraints; bare minimum healing)
> >>  - Wait ideally 3 months (private practice) to achieve full maturation/stability of tissues
 **Differentiation,** resulting in:
> 1. Flattening of cells, increased *tonofilaments*
> 2. Increased [[CIRO/PERIO/Periodontal Biology#^66e823|keratohyaline]] granules* , increased intercellular junctions
 3. Disappearance of *nucleus*
## Cell population:
- **keratinocytes** (90%) - principal cell type
-the other 10%:
- Melanocytes - pigment cells
- langerhans cells - immune cells; APCs to lymphcytes
- merkel cells - tactile receptors: pressure, temperature, 
- inflammatory cells

## Cell junctions and intermediate filaments found in keratinocytes
-  *Desmosomes* 
	- what? Cell junctions
	- Function? *strong adhesion* between adjacent keratinocytes 
	- on the cytoplasmic side, there are dense plaques where *tonofilament*s insert
- *Tonofilaments*
	- composed of protein, i.e. keratin
	- function? Helps skin resist mechanical stresses and maintain tissue integrity

## Basal Lamina
- known as the basement membrane
- joins the epithelium to the underlying connective tissue layer 
- major interface for metabolic exchange, since epithelium has no blood vessels
- undulating interface
	- papilla of connective tissue interdigitate with the epithelial rete pegs/ridges.
	- increases surface area rather than being flat
	- better attachment
- connected to the underlying connective tissue fibrils of Type IV collagen by ANCHORING FIBRILS
- permeable to fluids, but a barrier to particulate matter
- lies between the deepest layer of epithelium (Stratum Basale) and most superficial layer of connective tissue Lamina Propria
- consists of
	- 1. Lamina Lucida
		- for cell adhesion an signaling
			- laminins
			- integrins
	- 2. Lamina Densa
		- *Type I Collagen* - gingival fibers
		- *Type IV Collagen*

# Gingival Connective Tissue
- Pdl considered a specialized connective tissue
- is the major tissue in the gingiva and periodontal ligament
## Components
- cells (5%)
- collagen fibers (60% of the volume)
- blood vessels
- nerves (35%)
- intercellular matrix - mainly water

### Cell population
- fibroblasts  (65%)
- mast cells (heparin and histamine)
- macrophages (in during inflammation)
- neutrophils (defense)
- plasma cells (antibiody reaction)
- lymphocytes (defense)

## Types of fibers in Gingival Connective Tissue
1. Collagen
	1. type I
		1. gives tensile strength to gingival tissue
	2. type IV (branches between type I and around blood vessels)
2. Reticular
3. Elastic (oxystalan, elaunin, elastin fibers)
	- only *oxytalan fibers are found in the PDL*
		- more numerous an dense in the cervical region
	- *elaunin fbers are found in gingiva*
		- run vertically from teh cementum around the root and termninate at apex
	
## Gingival Fibers
- they consist of collagen type I
- the fiber bundles are capable to adapt stress
### Functions:
1. to brace the marginal gingiva firmly against the tooth
2. to provide the rigidity to withstand forces of mastication without being deflected from the surface
3. to unite the free gingiva to cementum and adjacent attached gingiva

### Gingival fiber groups - Type I Collagen
1) dentogingival group (DGF)
	1) the most NUMEROUS GROUP
	2) FROM CERVICAL CEMENTUM TO FREE AND ATTACHED GINGIVA
2) ALVEOLOGINGIVAL GROUP
	1) from alveolar crest into attached and free gingiva 
3) Circular group (CF)
	1) course through the CT or marginal and interdental gingiva 
	2) encircle the teeth in a ringlike fashion 
4) Dentoperiosteal group  (DPF)
	1) apically from cementum over the alveolar process 
5) Transseptal fiber system (TF)
	1) located interproximally
	2) from cementum in the base of the junctional epithelium into the same portion of the adjacent tooth 

![[assets/Gingival Fiber Groups.png|300]]

## Principal fibers (Periodontal fibers) - Type I Collagen
1) alveolar crest group (11)
	1) attached to cementum below the CEJ into the alveolus
2) horizontal group (12)
	1) from cementum to bone apical to alveolar crest group, just apical to the alveolar crest
3) oblique group (13)
	1) most numerous
	2) from cementum in a superior oblique direction into the bone
4) interradicular group (14)
	1) between the roots from cementum into bone
5) apical group (15)
	1) from cementum around the apex to bone (forming the base of the socket)

![[assets/perio Periodontal Fibers.png]]
### Intercellular matrix (Ground Substance):
- fills the space b/w cells and collagen fibers
- amorphous material that binds tissue and fluids
- *high water content*: 70% water
- produced mostly by **fibroblasts**
- function:
	- transport of water, electrolytes, nutrients, cell products between CT and cells
- contains
	- proteoglycans
		- hyaluronic acid
		- chondroitin sulfate
	- glycoproteins
		- fibronectin
		- laminin

fibronectin binds fibroblasts to collagen fibers
laminin attaches epithelial cell to basal membrane (where the laminin is the attachment site for the hemidesmosome that is on the basal layer of epithelial cells.)

What **type of epithelium** comprises the oral cavity?
1. Stratified squamous epithelium (3 variations)
	1. oral/outer epithelium - faces oral cavity; keratinized
	2. sulcular epithelium - faces tooth w/o being in contact w/ enamel; sulcus and crevicular fluid allow transport of antibiotics to the pocket/tooth - nonkeratinized with no rete pegs;
	3. Junctional epithelium - in contact w/ tooth and gingiva; termination of sulcus; 10-20 layers (adult) in the most coronal area to 1-2 layers thick towards the CEJ (in healthy tissue)
- function - protect deep structures while allowing selective interchange w/ the oral environment

the pdl is made of large collagen fibers
- prukin
- **sharpey's fibers**

0.2mm pdl in adult

surrounding the root of eachtooth is a specialized epithlium known as a: Junctional Epithelium

most abundant in the PDL (has all the cells below but most abundant is fibroblasts)
- **fibroblasts**
- osteoblasts
- cementoblasts
- osteoclasts

supragingival plaque:
a) is unattached or loosely adherent
b) is dominated by anaerobes
c) acquirees nutrition from saliva and host diet in the oral cavity

# Periodontium [[2024-03-13]]
- specialized connective tissue

Intercellular matrix
- collagen type I
- 70% water
- produced by fibroblasts
- function
	- transport water, electrolytes, nutrients, cell products b/w CT and cells
- width: 0.15 to 0.38 (avg 0.25mm)
	- wide in cervical then gets thin, then gets wider again at apical
	- thinnest portion around the middle third of the root
	- has shape of a sand clock

4 types of cells have been identified in the PDL
1. CT cells (FB, CBL, OBL) - FB Most common
2. Epithelial restts of Malassez (remnants of Hertwig root sheath, which disintegrate during root development)
3. Defense cells: neutrophils, lymphocytes, macrophages and eosinophils
4. Neurovascular elements

Function of the PDL
- functions are physical, formative, remodeling, nutritional and sensory
- physical functions are:
	- 1) provision of a soft tissue that "protects" vecssels and nerves from mechanical forces
	- 2) transmission of occlusal forces to the bone
- attachment of teeth to bone
- maintenace of gingival tissue int heir proper relationship to the teeth
- resistance to the impact of occlusal forces (shock absorption)

Shock Absorption
2 theories
1) tensional theory
- periodontal fibers have the main responsability in supporting forces
- the fibers unfold and striaghten and transmiit forces to the bone
- this causes an elastic deformation of the bone
proprioception - tell how hard or soft something is
2) The viscoelastic system theory
- considers the displacement of the ttooth to be controled by fluid movements
- fibers play a secondary role
- extracellular fluid passes from the PDL into the marrow space of bones

Formative and remodeling fucntiton
- cells in the PDL participate in formation and reosrption of bone and cementum
- also, to repair injuries
- here old cells are replaced by enw ones, especially fibroblasts
- mesenchymal cells develop into cementoblasts and osteoblasts
- rate of collagen synthesis is twice as fast as in the gingiva and four times fast than in skin

Nutritional and sensory functions
- pdl supplies nutritents to the cementum, bone and gingiva by blood vessels
- capable of transmitting tactile, pressure and pain sensations by trigeminal pathways
- nerve bundles pass into the periapical area from the apical area from bone following vessels
- mainly from superior an dinferior alvoelar arteries
- they pursue an dintrasoteal course and get..

Sources of blood supply
1. supraperiosteal arterioles: along lingual and facial surfaces of the alveolar bone along the sulcular epithelium
2. vessels of the PDL: extend into the gingiva and anastomose
3. arterioles: emerge from the crest of interdental 

The most important procedure in the treatment of a localized periodontal abscess is to:
a) prescribe an antibiotic
b) create a drainage of the inflammation through the pocket or by an incision
c) have the patient rinse twice daily with warm saline
d) leave it alone and let it clear up by itself

which of the following is notn correctly matched w/ regards to periodontal treatmen tplan
a) preliminary phase, - plaque control
b) phase i - mouth prep
c) phase Ii - periodontal srugery
d) phase IiI - restorative

All of the following signs and symptoms are typical of a perio-endo abscess except
a) radiographic involvement of the periodontium and periapex
b) minimal probing depths
c) percussion sensitivity
d) pulpal sensitivty

# The Normal Periodontium III
# Cementum - from Ten cates histology textbook
- calcified avascular mesenchymal tissue
- forms the outer covering of the anatomic root
- the main types of cementum are the acellular (primary) and the cellular (secondary)
- both consist of calcified interfibrillar matrix and collagen fibers

Two sources of fibers in the cementum:
1) Sharpey's fibers (extrinsic) by fibroblasts
2) fibers that belong to the cementum (intrinsic) by cementoblasts
- cementoblasts also produce proteoglycans, glycoproteins and phosphoproteins

Functions
1) insertion of the periodontal fibers
2) helps during reparation process
- bone has apposition and resorption processes = regeneration
- cementum only apposition during the tooth life

Acellular Cementum
- is the first to be formed
- covers from cervical third to the half
- does not contain cells
- its formed before the tooth reaches the occlusal plane
- thickness from 30 to 230 um
- formed mostly by sharpey's fibers has the principal role on supporting tooth 
- the number, size and distribution of fibers increases with function 

Cellular cementum
- formed after tooth reaches the occlusal plane
- its more irregular and contains cells = cementocyttes (encased in bone)
- sharpey's fibers are fewer and more separated than in the acellular cementum
- found in the apical third of the rootts
- thickness 150-250 um

Cementoenamel junction
- 60 to 65% of cases cementum noverlaps enamel
- 30% has an edge to edge but joint exists
- 5-10% cementum and enamel fail to meet

Remodeling
- bone changes in shape, resistance to forces, repair of wounds and calcium homoestasis in the body
- bone contains 99% of calcium of the body
- the major source for calcium release when it decreases in blood levels
- changes according to habits like bruxism, or systemic disease
- the bone matrix laid by OBL is nonmineralized and called osteoid
- while new osteoid is deposited the older one below becomes mienralized
- bone resorption is related to the appearance of a ruffled border (Howship's lacunae)
- Resorption generated by hydrolytic enzymes prdouced bye osteoclasts (CLS)
- [ ]  review bone anatomy; osteoid, haversian systems; ___ found not in all parts of the bone; just in certain parts
- enzymes digest the organic portion of bone
- its function can be regulated by hormones such as parathromone (PTH)

**Ten cate** describes resorptive process as follows:
1) attachment of the OCL to the nienralized surface of bone
2) Creation of a sealed acidic environment which deminieralizes bone

| Siebert's Classification | Description                 |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| Class I                  | There's height but no width |
| Class II                 | There's width but no height |
| Class III                | No width, no height         |
Class II easier to restore than Class I - width is easier to restore than height

Vertical defects
one wall defect - WORST scenario; only 1 wall remaining, the 3 are gone; require more than 1 surgery also required membrane
2 wall defect - there's 2 walls remaining
3 wall defect - there's 3 walls remaining

Crater defects - can be grafted up until the highest point of the defect (may have different heights on mesial/distal sides); not all are worth grafting

Furcation Involvement Classification
Hawp's (I to III)
Glickman's (I to IV)
- III soft tissue covering furca but goes through and through
- IV soft tissue doesn't cover furca and goes through and thgrough
- there are subclassifications
- ABC
	- vertical bone height
	- A: upper third
	- B: middle third
	- C: apical third
