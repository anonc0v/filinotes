# Action Items

# Osteoporosis 
- Introduction
- deficiency of bone matrix and bone salts
- more prevalent in women >age of 50 when **menopause** is fully established

## Classification 
1. Primary
	1. usually postmenopausal, age-related or idiopathic
2. Secondary
	1. caused by endocrine, gastrointestinal, hematological, CT or other disorders that may affect bone matrix and bone salts 

## Signs and Symptoms
- Manifested by varying degrees of reparative involement, pain, body deformity and pathological fractures which are the main complication 

## Treatment
- Lifestyle modifications that can help prevent or manage osteoporosis include regular weight-bearing exercise, adequate calcium and vitamin D intake, smoking cessation, and moeration of alcohol consumption. These modificaitons can also improve overall health and quality of life. 

# Bisphosphonates
- class of drugs that inhibit bone resorption. They have been used extensively in the management of osteoporosis and skelteal complications of cancer 
- Bone metastases
- osteoporosis 
- paget's disease etc.
- "bis" is a term indicating 2 phosphonate groups, attached to a common carbon atom
- have a high attraction for hydroxyapatite crystals and thus rapidly included into all parts of the skeleton
- inhibitors of osteoclastic activity to alleviate bone pain 

History
- 1897 Von Baeyer and hoffman started investigating about this drug 

## Types of Bisphosphonates 
- Non-nitrogenous (1st generation)
- Nitrogenous (2nd generation)
	- Alendronate - most common
- Third generation 

## Mechanism of action 
1. Inhibit development of osteoclasts
2. Induction of osteoclast apoptosis 
3. Reduction of osteoclast activity 
4. Prevention of development of osteoclasts from hematopoietic precursors 
5. Stimulation of production of an osteoclast inhibitory factor 
- effect can last 5-10 years 
- also inhibit angiogenesis (that's why it's prescribed for cancer patients to inhibit blood vessel formation in tumors)

Administration of bisphospohnates >>> reduced bone pain >>> increase exercise capacity >>> increase cortical bone thickness > increasebone strength fewer structures 

## Adverse effects of Bisphosphonates 
- common 
	- renal toxicity
	- acute phase reaction 
	- gastrointestinal toxicity
- emerging
	- osteonecrosis of the jaw 

## Osteonecrosis of the jaw 
- BON results from a complex interplay of bone metabolism, local trauma, increased demand for bone repair, infection, and hypovascularity 

### BON 
- In the early stages of oral BON, no radiographic manifestations may be seen. Patients usually are asymptomatic but may develop severe pain because necrotic bone becomes infected secondarily after it becomes exposed to the oral cavity 
- later, it looks like osteomyelitis (on the pano)
- osteonecrosis often is progressive and may lead to extensive areas of bony exposure and dehiscence. When tissues are acutely infected, patients may report severe pain an dlack of sensory sensation (paresthesia). This may be an indication of peripheral nerve compression. 
- since the secondary effect of BON is inhibition of angiogenesis, the wound won't close, and you'll have an open wound that will lead to osteomyelitis then lead to osteonecrosis
- mandibular has less irrigation/vessels than maxilla, so osteonecrosis is more common in mandible than maxilla

### Treatment of Osteonecrosis 
- Treatment strategies have included local surgical debridement, bone curettage, local irrigation with antibiotics, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy. However, none of these therapeutic modalities has proved successful. 
- therefore, an inability to manage lesions of bone compromises the oncologic, nutritional, and oral management of affected patients 

# Dental Management 
Treatment dentist should manage patients who are taking oral bisphosphonates in the following ways:
1. Medical consultation should be obtained to determine medical diagnoses and types of drugs taken. (osteoporotic patient or osteopenia - may be managed by calcium)
2. protocol for prevention of complications from cancer chemotherapy or radiation therapy:
	1. comprehensive examination 
	2. excellent periodontal health (eradicate infection or inflammation)
	3. immediate extraction of all non-restorable or questionable teeth
	4. elimination of dental caries 
	5. excellent oral hygiene and oral health maintenance 
3. routine dental care can and should be provided, with the use of routine local anesthetics. 
4. All procedures should be performed as atraumatically as possible with little tissue trauma, bleeding, and risk for postoperative infection 
5. Should BON occur, only sharp edges of exposed bone should be removed; minimal surgery should be performed. No definitive treatment for BON is available at this time.
6. In case of any infection, aggressive use of systemic antibiotics is indicated. 

### Vademecum:
Posolog칤a
Alendr칩nico 치cido
Oral: 10 mg/dia o 70 ms/sem. tomar al levantarse, en ayunas con agua (no agua mineral), 30 min antes de la 1st comida, bebida o medicamento del dia. No tumbarse hasta trascurridos al menos 30 min. Asociar Ca y vit. D si la ingesta es inadecuada. Reevaluar tto. tras 5 anos o mas anos de uso. 

Zoledronico acido 

## Lab test for osteoporosis:
- Densitometry

CTX
- Test to determine risk of osteonecrosis of the Jaw
- less than 150 pg/ml - higher risk
- 100-150 pg/ml - moderate risk
- >150 pg/ml - low risk 
- tests are only a guide; osteonecrosis can happen to patients even low risk; conversely, osteonecrosis may not happen in patients in high risk category

Arthritis = inflammation of the joints
Arthrosis = osteoarthritis = type of arthritis that causes joint breakdown 

Fase I 
- Verificar la toma de los medicamentos o cualquier cambio 
- Procedimientos lo menos traum치ticos posibles
- Solicitar que acuda con un acompa침ante
- Ayudar al paciente a subir y bajar de la unidad
- Evitar procedimientos prolongados con apertura maxima del paciente 
- (possibilty of secondary conditions like arthritis/arthrosis, may be taking corticosteroids)
- (favor the use of removable prosthetics instead of fixed prosthetics if patient cannot clean well)
