# Action Items

# Cancer 
- cancer is a condition characterized by uncontrolled growth of aberrant neoplastic cells 
- cancerous cells kill by destruction invasion of tissues, that is, by direct extension and spread to distant sites by metastasis through lymph nodes, blood, etc 
- cells that lose their ability to regulate DNA synthesis and the cell cycle. 
- cellular abnormalities of malignancy result in three common features: uncontrolled proliferation, ability to recruit blood vessels (i.e., neovascularization), and the ability to spread 

# Etiology 
Involves
- the accumulation of mutations and the loss of regulatory control over cell division, differentiation, apopotosis, and adhesion
- immunosuppression or reduced NK cells leads to cancer risk
Different kinds of mutations
- hereditary mutations 
- acquired mutation 
- inappropriate expression of a transcription factor 
- At least three to six somatic mutations are needed for a normal cell to be transformed into a malignant cell
*** 
Recommendations from the American Cancer Society 
- minimize: tobaco smoke and environmental and occupational marcinogens (e.g., asbestos fibers, arsenic compounds, chromium compounds, pesticides) 
- decrease: intake of alcohol, fat and exposure to UV light
- ensure: an adequate intake of dietary fiber and antioxidants (vitamins C and E, selenium)
- perform: moderate levels of physical activity 
*** 
Pathophysiology and Complications
- loss of regulatory control in a cell destined to become a cancer cell results in a series of pathologic changes that include hyperproliferative epithelium, dysplasia and finally carcioma 
- Metastasis 
	- malignant tumors overcome the limitation of anatomic boundaries by losing cell adherence....

Epidemiology 
Most common tumors 
in both womena nd men: lungs 
colon and rectum: 10, Urinary bladder - 6, prsotaste 9%
female:
breast: 15%
colorectal 10%, 
pancreas: 6% 

Head and neck cancer epidemiology
Head and neck: 4-5%, 7th in terms of mortality, 650k are diagnosed each year and around 350,000 a year from this cause
- most asymptomatic initially 
- not well-diagnosed
- late diagnosis 

Clinical manifestations 
signs and symptoms
- may present as a palpable mass that grows in size over time 
- initial features: changes in color, ulcers, lump, enlarged lymph nodes, or altered organ function
- symptoms: may include pain and paresthesia 
fisical exam 
- focus on questionary and fiscal examination, searching for tumors, nodules or stranges color lesions and quick weight loss 
Laboratory findings
- the diagnosis of cancer i based on micorscopic examination of an adequate sample of tissue taken from the lesion 
- tissue can be obtained by cytologic smear, needle biopsy, or inicisional or excisional biopsy

Clinical manifestations of skin cancer 
-primary types of skin cancer 
- basal cell carcinoma is the most common type followed by squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma 
	- slow growing, locally invasive tumors that arise in the basal layer of epithelium, generally as the result of chromosal changes caused by chronic exposure to UV light 
	- pearly papule with telangiectasias, a rolled waxy border, and a central ulceration ("rodent ulcer" 
	- less common types appear reddish, pigmented, or scarlike. Basal cell carcinomas are readily removed through cryotherapy and surgical excision.

Melanoma 
- melanoma is a malignant neoplasm that arises from melanocytes. this cancer primarily occurs in the skin but can occur at any site where melanocytes are found including the oral cavity 
- approximately 30% of melanomas arise from previously existing pigmented lesions, particularly those associated with a history of trauma 
- characterized by A, B, C, and D, that is Asymmetry, irregular Border, Color variation, and Diameter greater than 6mm 
- the color is usually deep and may be brown, grey, blue, or black multiple colors provide a prominent sign. bleeding, ulceration, firmness, and satellite lesions are characterestic of established lesions.

Clinical Manifestations of Oral Cancer 
More than 90% of cases are attributed to SCC. About 9% are carcinomas that arise from salivary gland tissue and other tissue types such as sarcoma and lymphoma. The remaining 1% or so are metastatic from elsewhere in the body. 
- White lesions that cannot be scraped off and are clinically mononspecific, called leukoplakia, are potential precursors lesions 
- Oral SCC has a variable appearance. It may occur as a white or red patch, an exophytic mass, an ulceration, a granular raised lesions, or combinations of these 
- most early carcinomas are asymptomatic and have an erythroplastic component Advanced lesions are more often ulcerated, with raised margins and induation. Pain is often absent until late in the course of the disease. High-risk sites include the floor of the mouth, lateral and ventral surfaces of the tongue, the soft palate, and surrounding tissues.

Medical management
- Radiation - focal; >50 gray4, which kills cells by damaging cancer cell DNA and chromosomes needed for cell replication, is used when tissue cannot be excised
- Chemotherapeutic - agents are most effective against rapidly growing tumors because they adversely affect DNA synthesis or protein synthesis of cancerous cells 
- Surgery - sometimes, radiation first in order to shrink the tumor, or need several surgeries
- Therapeutic modalities include surgery; radiation (external beam or implants); cytotoxic chemotherapeutic and endocrine drugs; and possibly, stem cell or bone marrow transplantation 

Complications of head and neck radiotherapy and myelosuppressive chemotherapy 
- nausea and vomiting (acute onset)
- mucositis - starts 2nd seek
- ulceration 
- taste alteration - 2 nd week 
- xerostomia - starts about 2nd week 
- secondary infection (fungal, bacterial, viral)
- bleeding (C)
- radiation caries (R) (delayed onset)
- hypersensitive teeth (acute and delayed onset)
- osteoradionecrosis (delayed onset - more common in mandible, less common in maxilla) 
- pulpal pain and necrosis (delayed onset - orthovoltage, not found with cobalt)

Dental Management 
- prior to cancer treatment 
	- extract nonrestorable teeth with poor prognosis, acute infection or severe periodontal disease
	- trim and smoothen sharp, bony edges; primarily closure should be obtained 
	- potential sources of infection should be ieradicated before radiation or chemotherapy 
	- Symptomatic nonvital teeth should be endondontically treated at least 1 week before initiation of head and neck radiation or chemotherapy 
	- to reduce the risk of mucositis and infection, tooth scaling and prophylaxis should be provided 
	- encourage oral hygiene with emphasis on implementation preventive treatment focused on remineralization and good tooth brushing 
	- removable prosthodontic appliances should be removed during therapy 
	- patients must be informed about problems associated with decreased salivary function, which include xerostomia, the increased risk of oral infection, including radiation caries, and the risk for osteoradionecrosis 

Guidelines for ttooth extraction in patient scheduled to receive radiation treatment to the head and neck (inlcuding th emouth) or chemotherapy 
Indications for extractions 
- PPD â‰¥6mm, excxessive mobility, purulence upon probing 
- periapical inflammation 
- tooth is borken down, nonrestorable, nonfunctional, or partially erupted; patient is noncompliant with oral hygiene measures 
- patients has no interest in saving tooth/teeth 
- tooth is associated with an inflammatory (e.g., pericoronitis), infectious, or malignant osseous disease 

Extraction guidelines 
- perform extraction with minimal trauma  
	- at least 2 weeks before initiation of radiation therapy 
- ideally 3 weeks before initiation of radiation therapy 
- at least 5 days (in maxilla) before initiation of chemotherapy 
- at least 7 days (in mandible) before initiation of chemotherapy 
- trim bone at wound margins to eliminate sharp edges 
- obtain primary closure 
- avoid intra-alveolar hemostatic packing agents that can bserve as a nidus of microbial growth 
- transfuse if the platelet count is less than 50,000/mm3 
- delay if the white blood count is less than 2000/mm3 or the absolute neutrophil is less than 1000/mm3 or is expected to be this level within 10 days; alternatively, prophylactic antibiotics (cephalosporin) may be used with extractions that are mandatory 

before cancer treatment, very aggressive
during, conservative 

During cancer treatment 
- acute toxicities are directly proportionate to the amount of radiation of cytotoxic drug 
- conservative treatment of the dental organs with fillings and root canals
- extraction of compromixsed and irreparable teeth (severe periodontitis, mobility, fractures, and caries) 
- applications of remineralizing substances before, during and post-irradiation 
- if added infection is suspected, use rinses with 0.12% chlorhexidine 
- in pediatric patients, apply pit sealants and fissures in newly erupted premolars and molars 
- modify cariogenic diet 
- the organism that most frequently opportunistically infects the oral cavity in individuals undergoing cancer therapy (who have hyposalivation and immunosuppression) is Candida Albicans. 
- be alert in case the patient takes bisphosphonates 
- bone marrow transplant
	- the dentist must have close and frequent communication with the oncology team that will follow the patient in all phases of treatment. It is very important to keep in mind that hese patients may be immunocompromised for prolonged periods and an invasive dental procedure may put them at risk. the oral and dental management of the dentist must have as main objectives to prevent infections. 

Mucositis
- eliminate infection and irritation; establish good oral hygiene  
- use mouth rinse (three choices are similar in controlling mucositis),
- recommend a salt and sodium bicarbonate mouthwash (1 tsp of each in 1 pint of water).
- provide elixir of diphenhydramine (benadryl) or viscous lidocaine 0.5% in Milk of Magnesia, Kaopectate, or sucralfate 
- chlorhexidine 0.12% (can be formulated in water by a pharmacist) 
- prescribe antiinflammatory agents (e.g., topical steroids, kamillosan liquidim)
- use protectants (e.g., orabase)
- avoid tobacco, alcohol, and carbonated drinks 
- follow a soft diet; maintain hydration 
- use a himidifier or vaporizer 
- considr topical and systemic antimicrobials, if severe. 
- use biologic response modifiers (under investigation). 

Xerostomia 
- recommend sugarless lemon drops, sorbitol based chewing gum, buffered solution of glycerine and water, or salivary substitutes 

radiation caries 
- educate patients about associated risks, and motivate them to maintain optimal oral hygiene 
- for daily application of fluoride, use custom trays that are contsructed of soft, flexible mouthguard material 
- trays hold 5 to 10 drops of a 1% to 2% acidulated fluoride gel that should be applied for 5 minutes each day. if the 1% to 2% acidulated gel is found to be irritating to the tissues, 0.5% neutral sodium fluoride gel may be subsituted. 
- frequent dental recall
- every month during first year
- restory early carious lesions 

secondary infection 

Sensitivity of teeth 
- give topical fluorides 

loss of taste 
- provide zinc supplementation 

osteoradionecrosis 
- caution with surgery 
- may need hyperbaric oxygen therapy 

Muscular dysfunction 
- insert tongue blade to ensure maximal opening of jaws and access to the oral cavity
