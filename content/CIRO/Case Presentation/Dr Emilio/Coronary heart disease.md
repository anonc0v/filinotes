# Action Items

# Coronary heart disease
- 8th risk ractors of cvds account for 61% of CV deaths:
1. alcohol use
2. tobacco use
3. **high blood pressure**
4. high body mass index/adiposity
5. high blood cholesterold and glucose 
6. low fruit and vegetable intake 
7. physical inactivity 

Ischemic Heart Disease 
- angina pectoris
- myocardial infarction 

Both IHDs caused by atherosclerosis 
- one of the major and most frequent causes of heart arrest 
- can also lead to heart attack, stroke, or death 
- group of disorders of heart and blood vessels in which the development of plaque occurs inside these arteries 

Plaque made of:
- fatty substanced
- cholesterol 
- etc 

1. Chronic endothelial injury 
2. endothelial dysfunction 
3. smooth muscle emigration from media to intima, macrophage activation
4. jkj
5. kjk

Causes of plaque formation 
- cmoking
- high cholesterol 
- high triglycerides 
- high blood pressure 
- diabetes or insulin resistance 

Systemic inflammation 

# Angina Pectoris 
- its not a symptom but a symptom 
- related to low income of oxygen going to heart 
- represents an underlying heart problem, usually coronary heart disease (CHD), also known as coronary artery disease (CAD)

## Angina: Precipitating Factors 
1. eating
2. emotion
3. exertion (exercise)
4. extreme temperatures (hot/cold) 


## angina: symptoms
- suffers oppressive and overwhelming pain in the chest, usually radiates to the left shoulder and arm, and sometimes to the fourth and fifth fingers, although irradiation has also been observed towarsd the neck, angle of the jaw and face on the same side. Pain < 20 minutes 
- may feel like indigestion
- may feel no pain but have other symptoms like shortness of breath or fatigue
- due to lack of oxygen to the heart muscle, it's called an "anginal equivalent"

## Types of Angina 

### Stable angina 
- heart muscle needs more black than it is getting
- triggered only by physical activity or strong emotions 
- usually lasts a short time
- treatment: rest or use of nitroglycerin 

### Unstable angina 
- Reduced blood flow to heart 
- going up stairs
- spontaneous  

### Vasospastic/variant Prinzmetal's
- spasmin the coronary arteries (which supply blood to the heart muscle)
- usually occurs while resting and during the night and early morning hours 
- Treatment: calcium antagonists and nitrates 

Men: pain is acute 
woman: missed diagnosis 

## Signs:
- elevated blood pressure 
- abnormalities in the rate and rhythm of the pulse
- distention of neck veins 
- peripheral edema
- cyanosis 
- corneal arcus and xantomas of the skin are related to hiperlipidemia and hypercolesterolemia (fordyce granules)
- panoramic radiographs demonstrate carotid calcifications 

## Medical management
- Nitroglycerin (vasodilators) - orthostatic hypotension
	- isosorbide-dinitrate
- antiplatelet agents (aspirin)
- beta-adrenergic blockers - orthostatic hypotension, lichenoid reaction - immune reaction seen in posterior buccal mucosa that looks like lichen planus
	- propranolol
	- nadolol
	- timodol
	- metropolol
	- atenolol (tenormin)
	- max dosage: 0.036mg epinephrine; 0.20mg levonordefrin)
- calcium channel blockers - gingival hyperplasia, sry mouth, lichenoid eruptions
	- diltiazem, nifepidine (procardia, adalat, nifedical), verapamil, amlodipine, 

# Myocardial infarction 
- death of cardiac cells, largely due to disruption of the atherosclerotic plaque 
- prolonged ischemia may result in necrosis for the area of the myocardium supplied by that vessel 
- any coronary seizure >20 minutes should be considered as a myocardial infarction 

## Risk factors for Acute Myocardial infarction 
- smoking
	- copd
	- hypercholesterolemia
	- hypertension 
	- diabetes 
- age 

Necrotic surface >40% of the ventricular wall = poor prognosis because it compromises cardiac output and cardiogenic shock can develop 
- more than 40% may need transplant
Necrosis > 10% minor complications 

Electrocardiogram: identify the site and size of the necrosis 
- PQRSJT
- ST-elevation
- ST-segment 
- SA node fires up the atria then goes to AV node and fires up the ventricles 

Cardiac Arrest tests:
- ECG
- chest xray
- echo
- angiogram (most common)
- cardiac monitoring
- cardiac enzymes: AST, LDH, CK, troponin, FBC, CRP, ESR

The basic management goal is to minimize the size of the infarction and prevent death from lethal arrythmias 
treatment depend on exent of ischemia 
	- initial treatment 
		- surgery for revascularization trhough catheterization of the stenosis 
	- ongoing support
		- medications lifestyle management 

Management for acute myocardial infarction 
- rapid hospitalization and determination of ST segment changes
- aspirin administration 
- early thrombolytic therapy (for ST segment elevation; done by hospital)
	- streptokinase
	- urokinase
	- alteplase
	- reteplase
- early revascularization 
	- thrombolysis (for st segment elevation only)
	- percutaenous
- pharmocologic therapy 
	- antiplatelet drugs
	- nitrates beta-adreneergic blockers 
	- ca channel blockers 
	- ACE inhbitiors 
	- lipid-lowering drugs 
	- anticoagulants 
	- morphine 
	- sedatives/hypnotics 
	- oxygen 

Dental management is based on the assessment of medical risk
- recent MI (7 to 30 daygs) and unstable angina = major risk for perioperative complications
- just limited to routine clinical examination 
- stable angina and past history of MI = intermediate risk 

Angina - Dental Management 
- assess the exact medical diagnosis 
- pharmacological treatment 
- frequency of the anginal attack: frequency, last event, how relief was obtained, pain at rest or sleep 
- triggers 
- how long does pain last 
- % of necrosis of heart muscle 

Stable angina and past history of myocardial infarction 
- medical consultation 
- short appointments
- comfortable chair position 
- take BP and pulse >20% or 160/100 mmHg, the appointment should be suspended and the refer to the physician (take initial then add 20%; )
- using pulse oximeter
- ask the patient for his/her short-acting vasodilators in case of emergency. 
	- pills
	- liquid 
	- spray 
- prophylactic use of the vasodilator in cases of high stress. (surgical events, extensive prosthesis)
- ask patient to bring nitroclygerin 
- stress-reduction measures
	- good communication 
	- oral sedation (triazolam 0.125-0.25mg on the night before and 1 hour before appointment)
		- *** depends on patient 
	- nitrous oxide/oxygen sedation 
	- excellent local anesthesia 
	- music
- limited use of vasoconstrictor (max 0.036mg epinephrine)
- avoid epinephrine-impregnated retraction cord 
	- there shouldn't be bleeding anyways if the sulcus is healthy 
- Avoid NSAIDs
- strict control of dentobacterial plaque. define the extent and complexity of the treatment plan based on the degree of hyposalivacity and tendency to caries. In case of hyposalivation make more frequent follow-up appointments 
- avoid sudden movements of the dental chair (hypotension)
- antibiotic prophylaxis not recommended for patients with coronary artery stents 
- antibiotic prophylaxis not recommended for history of coronary artery bypass graft 
- adequate postoperative pain control 
- patients who take warfarin: ask for a INR (international normalized ratio) before any invasive procedure 
	- ask for bleeding time, ptt, and INR
- Local hemostatic agents: suturing, gauze pressure packs and tranexamic acid for e-aminocaproic acid 

Supplementary tests 
- aspirin: bleeding time
	- normal range: 2-6 minutes, increase levels, avoid aspirin 3 days before the treatment 
- oral anticoagulants: INR 
	- <2.0 oral and periodontal surgery 
	- 2-2.5 Simple exodontia 
	- 3.0 Operative, prosthesis, infiltrative anesthesia 
	- >3.0 avoid any procedure 
- petechiae or ecchymosis: platelet count and bleeding time
- cardioregulatory medications may cause thrombocytopenia, (captopril, propanolol, atenolol, methyldopa, forsemide, hydrochlorothiazide or spironolactone) 

Drug interactions
- anticoagulant effect increases
	- erythromycin
	- tetracyclines
	- amoxicillin
	- sulfameethoxole and trimethroprin 

Unstable or variant angina or Recent myocardial infarction (<30 days**)
- they should only be treated under emergency situations, having consulted with their physician as long as the coronary problem is not stabilized they are at risk of suffering a myocardial infarction 
- anginous therapy with nitroglycerin will be premdicated 
- anti-stress therapy: psychosedation and oxygen 
- observation of the patient under. ahospiital environment 
- avoid nsaids 
- avoid sudden movements (orthostatic hypotension)

## Arrythmia
Any variation in the normal hearbeat 

Cardiovascular electrical system has 3 major categories:
1. electrical (cardiac arrhythmia)
2. circulatory (blood vessel abnormality)
3. structural 

Cardiac arrhythmia refers to a collection of irregular hearbeats caused by malfunction of hearts circulatory system 

Causes of cardiac arrhythmias 
- primary cardiovascular disease 
- pulmonary disorders 
- autonomic disorders 
- systemic diseases 
- drug-related adverse effects (metamphetamine)
- electrolyte imbalance

## types of arrhythmia 
sick sinus syndrome 
heart block 
atrial fibrillation (Afib)
	electrical impulses go out of control
	- heartbeat becomes rapid or irregular
atrial flutter
ventricular fibrillation (V-fib)
- most dangerous 
- stops flow of blood 

Signs and symptoms
- arrhythmias may be symptomatic or asymptomatic
- signs 
	- slow hearts rate (<60 beats/min)
	- fast heart rate (>100 beats/ min)
	- irregular rhythm 
- symptoms 
	- palpitations
	- fatigue dizziness
	- syncope
	- angina 
	- congestive heart failure
		- shortness of breath 
		- peripheral edema 
		- .... 

medical management 
- medications 
- pacemakers 
	- new is upper left superior area to avoid interfering with CPR electrical strips 
	- changed every 10-15 years 
	- always ask WHERE it is located 
- implanted cardioverter febrillator 
- radiofrequency catheter ablation 
- surgery 

Drugs to teach arrhythmia 
- Class I (sodium channel blockers)
	- quinidine - dry mouth, gingival bleeding, ulcerations; syncope, hypotension, nausea, vomiting, thrombocytopenia 
	- procainamide
	- propfaneone (rythmol) - dry mouth 
- class II (beta blockers) 
	- propranolol (nonselective beta blocker)

	- sotalol (betaspace)
- class IV (calcium channel blockers)
	- verapmili
	- diltiazem 
- misc
	- digoxin 

Sources of electromagnetic interference for pacemakers (ICDs

	- ultrasonic bath cleaners 
	- ultrasonic scalers 

Dental Management 
- stress and anxiety reduction 
	- good rapport 
	- short, morning appointments 
	- comfortable chair position 
		...

- vasoconstrictors
	- epinephrine can be used if the dose is limited to 0.036mg (2 capsules 1:100,000) high doses increases the risk
	- avoid use epinephrine in retraction cord 
	- intravascular injection are to be avoided 
	- vasocontrictors should be avoided in aptients taking digoxin 
	- patients taking digoxin: watch our for signs and symptoms of toxicity 
	warfarin
	- should have INR (within 24 hours of surgery)
	- INR = 2-3 minot surgery can be performed without stopping coumadin 
- pacemakers 
	- antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended 
	- avoid use of electrosurgery and ultrasonic scaler 
- high risk patients requiring urgent care
