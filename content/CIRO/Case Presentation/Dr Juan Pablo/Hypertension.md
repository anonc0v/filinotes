# Blood Pressure 

Definition: force of blood pushing against blood vessel walls (mmHg)

**Systolic** - maximum force against arteries generated by the contraction of the Left Ventricle.  1st Korotkoff sound.
**Diastolic** - minimum force against arteries, which occurs when the heart is in a state of relaxation between contractions.  In other words, it is the residual pressure against the arteries during the resting phase of the cardiac cycle.  *5th Korotkoff sound*

### Epidemiology 
US: 45% have hypertension (AHA, 2018)
Mexico: 49.2% have hypertension (ENSANUT, 2020)
Globally: Number 1 cause of morbidity and mortality.

# Hypertension

**Acute hypertension:** temporary rise in blood pressure caused by a stimulus
- stress
- anxiety
- tension
- anger
- nervousness
- White Coat Syndrome
**Chronic hypertension:** Blood pressure remains high with or without stimuli.

Receptors:
alpha 1 receptors
- primarily on vascular smooth muscle cells
- activation >>> vasoconstriction
- blockers >>> vasodilation
alpha 2 receptors (location: CNS)
- affects sympathetic outflow in the CNS
- activation >>> inhibition of sympathetic nervous system
	- decreases release of norepinephrine
	- lowers BP
- Beta 1 receptors
	- primarily in heart muscle
	- activation <>>> inc heart rate, contractility, conduction velocity >>> inc cardiac output
	- blockers >>> decrease HR and BP
- Beta 2 receptors
	- not directly targeted by hypertensive medications
	- activation of beta 2 receptors >>> asthma treatment

# Side Effects of Hypertensive medications

- Dry mouth, taste changes, and ulcerations
- Gingival hyperplasia - Ca++ esp. nifedipine
- angioedema - RAAS blockers
- gingival bleeding - direct vasodilators

# Pharmacological Interactions

- NSAIDs decrease the effect of diuretics, beta-blockers, ACE inhibotrs, Central agonists, vasodilators, alpha blockers

# Hypertensive urgencies vs emergencies

### Urgencies
- Elevated BP, but no organ damage
- no need to refer to emergency department
- do not treat with IV antihypertensives

#### Emergencies
- BP >180/120mm Hg
	- end organ damage
		- ischemia >>> ⇧ inflammation
		- brain, heart, kidneys, retina, uterus (placenta)
	- damages small arterioles >>> endothelial injury
	- ⇧ permeability of blood vessels
	- Activates coagulation cascade >>> inflammatory response
	- activation of RAS >>> vasoconstrction + inflammation
