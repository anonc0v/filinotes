Iron Deficiency Anemia: 42% of pregnant women were observed to be iron deficient in the first trimester.

Gestational Diabetes: Global prevalence of GDM was 14.7%.

High Blood

Pressure Related to Pregnancy pre-

eclampsia): Preeclampsia is a pregnancy-specific disorder that affects 2 to 8% of all

pregnancies and remains a leading cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality worldwide.

Hyperemesis Gravidarum: In approximately 0.3 - 3% of pregnancies.

Supine hypotensive syndrome: (also referred to as inferior vena cava compression syndrome) is caused when the gravid uterus compresses the inferior vena cava when a pregnant woman is in a supine position, leading to decreased venous return centrally. Up to 8% of women in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy can be affected.

Infections (Flu, vaginal yeast infections, uterine infections,

group B streptococcus, bacterial vaginosis, and listeria): Overall, 63.6% of women reported at least one infection during pregnancy. Reports of infections were more common during pregnancy than in the 3 months before pregnancy.

• Depression and Anxiety: Individual disorder

prevalence estimates ranged from 1.1% for PTSD to 4.8% for specific phobia, with the prevalence of having at least one or more disorder estimated to be 20.7% [16.7% to 25.4%]. There was evidence of a small (3.1%) tendency for pregnant women to be more susceptible to anxiety disorders than postpartum women.

• Fetal Alcohol Syndrome: The overall

prevalence of FAS in the United States was estimated by the Institute of Medicine to be between 0.5 and 3.0 per 1,000 births. Based on the review presented here, which has the advantage of more recent studies, we believe that FAS prevalence in the general population of the U.S. can now be estimated to be between 0.5 and 2 per 1,000 births, and the prevalence of FAS and ARBD combined is likely to be at least 10 per 1,000, or 1 percent of all births.

Increased facial pigmentation (Chloasma/melasma): Chloasma is a required

hypermelanosis of sun-exposed areas during pregnancy and it can affect 50-70% of pregnant women. It presents as symmetric hyperpigmented macules, which can be confluent or punctuate. The most common locations are the cheeks, the upper lip, the chin and the forehead.

Gingivitis, Periodontitis: The pregnant women showed poor oral hygiene with the mean OHI-S score as 2.68.

Gingivitis was prevalent in almost all the pregnant and nonpregnant women. However, it was found more severe in pregnant women with mean gingival score as 1.25. A definite increase in gingivitis was found from Trimester II to Trimester IlI. Among pregnant women, the prevalence of periodontal disease is also high, ranging from 10 to 74%.

Pyogenic

granuloma(Pregnancy

tumor): A pregnancy tumor has a prevalence of 0.2-9.6% during gravidity. They most commonly appear after first trimester, grow rapidly, and typically regress after delivery

▪Management of oral emergencies.  
Pulpitis, fever or abscesses should be treated at

any stage of pregnancy.

• First trimester (conception to 14th week): The most critical and rapid cell division and active organogenesis occur between the second and the eighth week of post conception. Therefore, the greater risk of susceptibility to stress and teratogens occurs during this time and 50% to 75% of all spontaneous abortions occur during this period.

| Educate   | Educate the patient about maternal oral changes during pregnancy.                |
| Emphasize | Emphasize strict oral hygiene instructions and thereby plaque control.           |
| Limit     | Limit dental treatment to periodontal prophylaxis and emergency treatments only. |
| Avoid     | Avoid routine radiographs. Use selectively and when needed.                      |

• Second trimester (14th to 28th week):

Organogenesis is completed and therefore the risk to the fetus is low. Some elective and emergent dentoalveolar procedures are more safely accomplished during the second trimester.

- Oral hygiene instruction, and plaque control.
- Scaling, polishing, and curettage may be performed if necessary.
- Control of active oral diseases, if any.
- Elective dental care is safe.
- Avoid routine radiographs. Use selectively and when needed.

• Third trimester (29th week until childbirth):

Although there is no risk to the fetus during this trimester, the pregnant mother may experience an increasing level of discomfort. Short dental appointments should be scheduled with appropriate positioning while in the chair to prevent supine hypotension. It is safe to perform routine dental treatment in the early part of the third trimester, but from the middle of the third trimester routine dental treatment should be avoided.

- Oral hygiene instruction, and plaque control.
- Scaling, polishing, and curettage may be performed if necessary.
- Avoid routine radiographs. Use selectively and when needed.
- Avoid elective dental care during the second half of the third trimester.
- Supine position should be avoided.
	- compression of the **inferior vena cava**: transient hypoxia or Supine Hypotensiven Syndrome, which generates loss of consciousness
- Sit up or left lateral position with head of the chair elevated
- The use of diazepam, tetracyclines, streptomycin and barbiturates is CONTRAINDICATED.

Stress Management
- Avoid the stress of the dental consultation through cordial treatment.
- Techniques as atraumatic as possible. 
- Short but effective appointments.
- Deep and long lasting local anesthesia.

Xray radiation 
Teratogenic dose: fetus of radiation is **5 to 10 Rads**, a dose difficult to reach with medical or dental x-rays.
Source: 
- Periapical radiography; dose: 0.00005 rads
- FMX (18); dose: 0.0001 radiographs 
- chest x-ray: 0.01 to 0.10
- Solar radiation: 0.0004
- The second trimester is the safest to take x-rays.

ANALGESICS
- Paracetamol: analgesic of choice in pregnancy.
- Codeine and propoxyphene: they can cause the development of
cleft lip and palate, especially if used in the first trimester.
- Avoid prolonged use of ASA in advanced stages of pregnancy due to bleeding complications that may occur during childbirth.
- Chronic use of ASA, Ibuprofen and Naproxen can produce: 
	- Gastric ulceration, and gastric reflux.  
	- Tendency to bleed.  
	- Anaemia.
	- Inhibition of the production of prostaglandins delaying labor, prolonging pregnancy and prematurely closing the ductus arteriosus, generating pulmonary hypertension.

LOCAL ANESTHETICS
▪All local anesthetics with adrenergic vasoconstrictor can be safely used at APPROPRIATE DOSES AND CONCENTRATIONS.
▪They have not been shown to have an abortifacient or teratogenic effect.
✓The use of Lidocaine and Mepivacaine over Prilocaine is recommended.
✓Avoid local anesthetics without vasoconstrictors by: Risk of toxicity,
Shorter duration and
Lower anesthetic depth.
