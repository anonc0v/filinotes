# Action Items

# Asthma 

## Symptoms
1. Wheezing
2. Cough
3. Shortness of breath

***Due* *To***: Obstruction of airways
```
vs RUPTURE of alveolar sacs = pulmonary emphysema
```

Asthmatic:
- Relaxed smooth muscles
- excess music
- wall inflamed and thickened

During asthmatic attack
- tightened smooth muscles
- excess mucus
- wall inflamed and thickened
## Pathophysiology
- Airway  edema
	- cellular infiltration: eosinophils, activated helper T cells, Mast cells, +/- neutrophils
- Increased airway secretions: Mucus
	- The overreaction of the bronchus to a stimulus is directly proportional to the variable obstruction of airflow

Oral Manifestations
- Ipatropium - xerostomia
- B-adrenergic Agnists - dry mucous membranes
- From dry mouth 
	- cavities
	- mouth sores 
	- bad breath
	- gum disease
- Long-term corticosteroids: Mouth uclers
- Oral candidiasis (Mouthwash, after application)

Treatment:
Long-term/Maintainenace:
Acute/Symptoms

Pharmacological considerations:
- Acteylsalicylic acid and NSAID - triggers asthmatic symtpoms; Instead, for pain control use **Lysine clonixinate or dextropropoxyphene**
- No contraindication with epinephrine, but the sodium metabisulfite, the preservative in [[LOCAL ANESTHETICS]]  can trigger asthma.
- Adrenaline and B2 agonist (Salbutamol): can cause synergy; increase blood pressure and arrythmias.  Use **Felipressin** if patient has cardiovascular disease.

Risk of adrenal (corticosteroid) seizures

Management of Asthma attack:
Asthmatic attack:
- Suspend dental consultation. Remove all intraoral devices. Comfortable position for the px. Permeable airway.
- Administer β2-agonist (salbutamol). Oxygen.  
- Activate medical alert assistance.

Dental management
1. Asthmatic controlled patients can be treated in the dental office
2. Clinic history (triggers, severity, frequency, pharmacotherapy)
3. Work in ventilated area
4. Short, stress free appointment
5. Make sure the patient brings his/her inhaler at every appointment
6. Avoid long periods of flat position on the dental chair
7. Moderate and severe cases: Inhalation of the bronchodilator preventively, before the appointment
8. Assess the use of the rubber dam
9. Afternoon appointments
10. Preventive measures: fluoride, recaldent (by use of β inhaled agonists, as they decrease salivary flow)
11. Monitor for xerostomia (due to use the inhaler and mouth breathing)
12. Strict control of dentobacterial plaque and control appointments every 3 months
13. Recommend rinse after using inhaler to avoid Candidiasis
14. Avoid barbiturates, narcotics, anti-histaminines
15. Avoid aspirin, NSAIDs
16. Avoid Macrolides (Erythromycin, Clarithromycin, Azithromycin) in patients taking Theophylline

Mild Asthmatic Crisis 
- O2 Sat >95%
- Salbutamol NEB + Salbutamol MDI 2-4 puffs q 20 min for 1 hours
- sentences
Moderate Asthmatic Crisis
- 90-95%
- Salbutamol NEB + Salbutamol MDI 6-8 puffs + corticosteroid (e.g. prednisone) + if no response to salbutamol >>> ipatropium bromide 
- phrases
Severe Asthmatic Crisis
- <90%
- Salbutamol Nebulizer + Ipatropium bromide q 20 min for 1 hour + Corticosteroids + sulfato de magnesio 40-50mg/kg iv (max 2g) en 20 min
- Ambulance + continue salbutamol NEB and IV
- words
Impending failure
- silent
- either increased respiratory rate or slowing.
