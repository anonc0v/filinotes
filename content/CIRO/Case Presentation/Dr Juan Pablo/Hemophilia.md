1. Family history of hemophilia
2. male sex

Risk factors for Acquired Hemophilia
1. >60 years old
2.  Autoimmune disorders

Key diagnostic factors 
- presence of risk factors
- history of recurrent/severe bleeding
- bleeding into muscle
- prolonged bleeding following heel prick or circumcision

Activated Factor IX
- vitamin K-dependent protein
- synthesized in liver
- forms thrombin

Diagnosis 
- clotting factor assays/test

- Moderate: 1% to 5%
- Severe: <1%

Treatment
- replace clotting factor 
1. Plasma-derived factor concentrates
	1. freeze-dried product
