  abstract = {The mucous membrane that lines the structures within the oral cavity limits is known as~oral mucosa. This is a wet soft tissue membrane that extends from the junction between the vermilion border of the lips and labial mucosa anteriorly to the palatopharyngeal folds posteriorly. Histologically, the oral mucosa is formed by three layers, a surface squamous stratified epithelium, known as the~oral epithelium, whose thickness and degree of keratinization depend on the location and functional requirements~. Beneath is an underlying connective tissue, known as~lamina propria, and~a dense irregular connective tissue, the submucosa, which is found at the deepest level. The latter is absent in some oral cavity regions, where the lamina propria is directly bound to the bone or muscle. The oral mucosa can be classified into lining mucosa, masticatory mucosa, and specialized mucosa, with distinctive histological, clinical, and functional features. The variety of functions that the oral mucosa develops mainly includes protecting the underlying tissues from mechanical, chemical, and biological stimuli, secretion of essential substances, and a sensory function, which allows the perception of temperature, touch, pain, and taste~.},

  abstract = {Cellular Phenotype and Apoptosis: The function of epithelial tissues is the protection of the organism from chemical, microbial, and physical challenges which is indispensable for viability. To fulfill this task, oral epithelial cells follow a strongly regulated scheme of differentiation that results in the formation of structural proteins that manage the integrity of epithelial tissues and operate as a barrier. Oral epithelial cells are connected by various transmembrane proteins with specialized structures and functions. Keratin filaments adhere to the plasma membrane by desmosomes building a three-dimensional matrix., Cell-Cell Contacts and Bacterial Influence: It is known that pathogenic oral bacteria are able to affect the expression and configuration of cell-cell junctions. Human keratinocytes up-regulate immune-modulatory receptors upon stimulation with bacterial components. Periodontal pathogens including P. gingivalis are able to inhibit oral epithelial innate immune responses through various mechanisms and to escape from host immune reaction, which supports the persistence of periodontitis and furthermore is able to affect the epithelial barrier function by altering expression and distribution of cell-cell interactions including tight junctions (TJs) and adherens junctions (AJs)., In the pathogenesis of periodontitis a highly organized biofilm community shifts from symbiosis to dysbiosis which results in destructive local inflammatory reactions., Cellular Receptors: Cell-surface located toll like receptors (TLRs) and cytoplasmatic nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs) belong to the pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). PRRs recognize microbial parts that represent pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)., A multimeric complex of proteins known as inflammasome, which is a subset of NLRs, assembles after activation and proceeds to pro-inflammatory cytokine release., Cytokine Production and Release: Cytokines and bacterial products may lead to host cell mediated tissue destruction. Keratinocytes are able to produce diverse pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-8 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-{$\alpha$}. Infection by pathogenic bacteria such as Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (A. actinomycetemcomitans) can induce a differentiated production of these cytokines., Immuno-modulation, Bacterial Infection, and Cancer Cells: There is a known association between bacterial infection and cancer. Bacterial components are able to up-regulate immune-modulatory receptors on cancer cells. Interactions of bacteria with tumor cells could support malignant transformation an environment with deficient immune regulation., The aim of this review is to present a set of molecular mechanisms of oral epithelial cells and their reactions to a number of toxic influences.},

  abstract = {The continuity of epithelial tissue is collapsed by tooth eruption. The junctional epithelium (JE) is attached to the tooth surface by hemidesmosomes, which constitutes the front-line defense against periodontal bacterial infection. JE constitutively expresses intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and neutrophils and lymphocytes penetrate into JE via interaction between ICAM-1 and LFA-1 expressed on the surface of these migrating cells. JE also expresses cytokines and chemokines. These functions of JE are maintained even in germ-free condition. Therefore, the constitutive expression of adhesion molecules, cytokines, and chemokines might be used not only for anti-pathogenic defense but also for maintaining the physiological homeostasis of JE. In this review, we have mainly focused on the structural and functional features of JE, and discussed the function of intraepithelial lymphocytes in JE as a front-line anti-microbial defense barrier and regulator of JE hemostasis.},

A total of 288 sites in 30 patients were examined. If a space was visible apical to the contact point, then the papilla was deemed missing; if tissue filled the embrasure space, the papilla was considered to be present. The results showed that when the measurement from the contact point to the crest of bone was 5 mm or less, the papilla was present almost 100\% of the time. When the distance was 6 mm, the papilla was present 56\% of the time, and when the distance was 7 mm or more, the papilla was present 27\% of the time or less.},
