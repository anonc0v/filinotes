#Diabetes

# Diabetes
- chronic disorder caused by elevated blood sugar levels
- hypoglycemia
	- diabetic coma

## Lab tests
FBS - 8 hours fasting
Glucometer - 2 hours fasting after meal
HBA1c - levels of glycosylated hemoglobin over past 3 months (life cycle of hemogloblin)

Glucose tolerance test
- before drinking liquid with sugar, and then after

Risk factors rype 2

## Epidemiology

15.6% adults >20 have diabetes
30% of Mexican adults - unawaree of their condition
3rd leading cause of death (due to complications) in MExico
worldwide - 2nd leading cause of death
1st cause - blindness, kidney failure, and amputations in adults

Diabetes standards of medical care - bookk

Insulin
- take glucose into cell;
- produced by beta cells of pancreas
If insulin doesn't function properly or isn't produced, glucose stuck in blood and causes oxidative damage to endothelial cells

ketoacidosis >>> b/c body is breaking down fat cells 

## Diabetes types
type I - insulin not produced
- autoimmune B-cell destruction
- in children can be diagnosed like at age 4 instead of birth b/c they have autoimmune disease that eventually results in destruction of B cells
- insulin-dependent diabetes/ juvenile-onset diabetes
- B-cell destruction is rapid in normally babies/children; slow in adults
- ketoacidosis common in i NOT in II
type II - rinsulin produced but insulin eceptors are defective - only 5% of cases
- progressive loss of B-cell insulin secretion w/ insulin resistance (related to receptors)
- better prognosis than type I

Drug intake - glucocorticoid use (in HIV/AIDS patients, or after organ transplantion)

Gestational diabetes - diagnosed in 2nd or 3rd sem; NOT 1st; if 1st they probably had type ii

Sucrose = glucose + fructose

# major complications of diabetes
microvascular - eye, kidney, neuropathy
macrovascular - brain, heart, extremities

chronic hyperglycemia >10 years = dysfunction and failure of several organs

Classic symptoms:
polyuria
polydipsia
polyphagia
major weight loss

viral infections that can cause destruction of B cells
- coxsakie group B virus
- parotitis
- measles
- cytomegalovirus
- rubella
- glandular fever

Classifcation for type I
- children - typtically present polyuria/polydipsia, and 1/3rd have diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)
- Adults - may not have classic sypmtoms; may have tenoporary remission from need fo rinsulin.

Risk factors for type 2 diabetes
- overweight and obseity
- lack of physical activity
- age
- family history
- other factors - eating unhealthy, smoking, alcohol
- history of other disease - hypertension

Gestational Diabetes
- compication - preeclampsia
- goes away after childbirth
- risk factor for both mom and baby for dev't of type 2 diabetes
- best test is basal (fasting) blood glucose = >126mg/dl (u.0)

Goals of diabetic therapy
1. elminate symptoms of hyperglycemia
2. eliminate vascular complications
3. patient has normal life

ABCs for controlling diabetes
1) control A1c
2) Blood presesur
3) cholesterol 

Pharmacological considerations
Sulfonylureas (glibenclamide) - AVOID NSAID b/c it can cause hypyoglycemia
Thiazides - w/ corticosteroids it makes hyperglycemia
steeroids - hyperglycemia - avoid monitor glucose or adjust doses
No contraindications for use of local anesthetics w/ vasoconstrictor (unless they have hypertension, or heart damage, or vascular complications )

Oral manifestations
- xerostomia - due to gland dysfunction and medications
- bacterial, viral, fungal infections. Candidiasis - most common; depressed immune system
- Burning mouth syndrome
- caries
- oral mucosa alterations: REccurent aphthous stomatitis; oral lichen planus (OLP direct relation with hypeertension and diabetes)
- periodontal abscesses
- periodontitis
- poor wound healing

Oral changse
- poor glycemic control cause
- ketone breath. (glucose greater than 160mg/dl)
- healing problems
- atrophy of the mucosa
- depapilation of the back of the tongue (microangiopathy)
- tendency to infections (Ludwig's angina, Candidiasis)
- prosthesis stomatitis
- angular cheilitis
- middle rhomboid glossitis
- hyposalivation/xerostomia
- dsgeuisa
- neuropathy (burning mouth) - due to xerostomia

Relationship b/w diabetes and gingivitis
- hyperglycemia >>> exacerbation of inflammatory response (il-17, il21) >>> metabolic alteration clinical manifestations of the diseases
Gingival inflammation >>> insulin resistance >>> hyperglycemia

```
OSCE exam
**Hypoglycemia
- cold and clammy, needs some candy

Tachycardia
irritability
restlessness
excessive hunger
diaphoresis
```

Hypoglycemia
Blood sugar <70mg/dl

1mg glucagon (intramuscular or intravenous) or 50mL of 50% intravenous dextrose solution for 2-3 minutese if possible
0.5mg of subcutaneous or intramuscular epinephrine at a concentration of 1:1000 and rpaet every 15 minutese until necessary.

hypoglycemia - emergency
hyperglycemia - not emeregency

```

hyperglycemia
- hot and dry, sugar high

Sweet breath (ketoacidosis)
increased thirst 
nausea and vomiting
frequent urination
loss of clear vision
```

> [!info] 
> ## hyperglycemic coma: blood glucose level 300-600 mg/dl
> ## hypoglycemic coma: blood glucose <40mg/dl


emergency
1. control pain
2. control infection


A1c greater than >10%, there is risk of stroke, death. no dental tx should be performeed
morning appointments - depends on medication
max for surgery: 180 mg/dl
