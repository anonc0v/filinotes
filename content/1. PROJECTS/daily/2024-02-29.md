biomechanical preparation
- removal of biological tissue for prosthetic purposes - irreversible - requires remarkable attention and care in the smallest details
decision of prep depend on 3 things:
occlusion - 
structural analysis of each tooth - periodontal health, inclincation etc.
restorative material

Fundamentals of dental prep
- removal of cavities and clinical evaluation of existing restoration
- acceptable structural design of fixed restorations to withstand functional forces
- reinforcement of remaning dental sturcture
- preserve healthy tissue
- gingival margin design to give health to surrounding tissues

biomech prep
- follows anatomical crown of tooth

objectives
- biological
- mechanical
- aesthetics

biological
- preserve endodontical integrity
- preserve integrity of adjacent tissues
- biological width

3 main strategies to prevent gingival recession
1. achieve optimal soft tissue health
provisional quality
2. minimizing iatrogenic soft tissue trauma during placement of margins ad the gingival displacement procedure
3. remove all tenpomrary excess cement and wait for an appropriate period of time to allow the tissues to heal afte rperiodontal surgical therapy.

mechanics
- adequate thickness of restorative material
- correct design of preparation
	- no sharp edges
- finish line

aesthetics
- optical illusion
	- light hits the tooth and bounces back; goes through enamel (translucent)
- emergency profile
	- how crown emerges from gingiva

IDeal abutment
- good bone support w/ healthy soft tissue profile
- good postiion to resist strength and better aesthetic results
- good crown - root proportion
	- min: 1:1

Ante's law
- "The are of the surface of the roots of the abutments must be equal to or greater than that of th epieces to be replaced by pontics"
	-Johnston y col.

4 Basics
- preservation of dental structure
- retention and stability
- structural hardness
- integral margins

Biomechnaical prep
- generally prep of tooth must have a max wear of 2mm. To gigve space to the restoration
- excessive carving of tooth could sacrifice the retention and resistance of the restoration

Retention - prevents mobilits in its insertion 
stability - 

Designing tooth prep for optimal success (journal article)

Total occlusal convergence (TOC) is the angle formed between two opposing prepared axial surfaces.  An appropriate clinical target for /OCD is from 10 to 20.

geometry of preparation is the factor that is under the control of th eoperator and that allows a restoration to stay in place or not.

Analisis tridimensional
upper molars = rhomboid
mandibular molars = rectangular shape
premolars and anterior teeth = oval shape

Insertion path
- avoids displacement
- parallelism

ideal taper 16 deg?

The retension is due to the friction of the axial wall prep

REtention can be enhanced by grooves

2) diamond - crown; choose coarseness: avoid black and green for tooth prep

Average thickness of enamel vs dentin
enamel:
- 0.3-0.5mm cervical
- - 0.5-0.6 - middle third
- 1.3-1.5mm / 1.0-1.3 mm = occlusal 
-- dentin:
3-3.5 to cusp; 2-3mm to central groove (from pulp to dentinoenamel junction)

Provisional and management of soft tissues
- they must have similar requirements to definite proshethes, differences: LOWER RESISTANCE, DURABILITY, AESTHETIC APPERANCE
- MUST PROMOTE AND MAINTAIN HEALTH OF THE ORAL TISSUES AND KEEP THEM STABLE WHENEVER PERMANET PROSHETHESIS are made

objective
- pulp protection
- position stability
- to maintain occlusal function
- cleaning
- strength
- esthetics

temp material
- Bisacrylic - resin + acrylic
- acrylic 

## Functions
- endodontics
- periodontal
- prosthetics
- aesthetics

Functions
endodontics
- avoid pulp irritation by protecting exposed dentin by tooth prep
- periodontal
	- surface texture 
	- cervical contour
	- papillary space
	- pontic base - ovoid shape
proeshteics
- dental reconsturction
- replacement of teeth
- functional occlusion
esthetics
- shape
- colour
- texture
- emergence profile

emergence profile
- helps maintain the shape of the interdental papilla, the proximal contours and the natural gingival appearance
- appropriate emergence profiles divert food from gingival tissues preventing soft tissue damage during chewing

materials
- acrylics - liquid systems based on polymethylmethacrylate; liquid - powder
- bisacryl - based on resinous compounds - paste - paste

acrylic physical periods
1. grainy sandy or liquid
	-no cohesive force
2. filamentous
- sticky
3. **plastic**
- it is not sticky
- stage to use the acrylic
- irreversible reaction
4. elastic
- exothermic stage
5- rigid
- final stage of polymerization

Types of acrylics
- self-curing acrylyic
- heat-curing acrylic
	- for temporary crowns sent to ortho
		- PMMA also used

clincical management of acrylics
1. shell technique
	- minimal 0.5mm thiekness prep on cast
	- make provisional >>> thin provisional
	- reline after prep on patient
1. tryin
2. occlusion verifciation
3. relining w/ acrylic
4. mark finish lines
5. mark contact areas
6. excessive cuts
7. interproximal cuts
8. occlusion adjustment
9. anatomy an dpolishing
10. cementation
11. excess removal

Bisacryl
advantage
- without smell
- less contraciton
- less exothermal reaction
- very good aeshteeic
- easy to repair
- resistant to abrasion
- easy maniuplation
disadvantages
- you cannot handle its viscosity
- thick and sticky layer
- it is moree fragile

ovoid pontics
- obtain th epresence of interproximal papilla thorugh thte proshtesis and avoid the appearance of black triangles that favor the accumulation of food and, in addition, counteract the aesthetics and periodontal health to achieve a better dentiogingival architecture, and if it already exists, maintain it
- the material to be used in contact with the gum must have smooth and highly polished surface to avoid any inflammation
- easy to clean

- how to shape ovoid - 2 ways
	- 1) contour the cast before making your provisional to make the pontic shape (facing the mucosa) avoid.
		- "score" the cast so that it appears concave (thus, pontic shape will be ovoid)
	1) Try in provisional (does not have ovoid shape yet)
	- remove the provisional and add acrylic (1-2mm shaping it into ovoid shape)
	- you will see blanching when you add
	- ask patient to bite for 2-3 minutes
	- they should have no more pain
	- may be a bit uncomfortable for a few days but the mucosa will adjust.

- reebasase semanalmente causando la menor isquemia en el margen gingival lo que le permite desarrollarse hasta su correcta forma

# CRITICAL THINKING

minimally invasive fluoris treatment
- fluorisis
	- excess intake of fluroide during enamel formation >>> color abnormalities or defecxts on tooth surfcae
	- treatment
		- whitening
		- restoration
		- microabrasion, athomebleaching 2 weeks, subsequent resin infiltration
		- 22 yo w/ df
	- classification
	- mild (chalky)
	- moderated (pigmented)
	- severe (defective)
- mild fluorosis
	- microabrasion less effective than bleaching technique
- slurry mixture opalustre
