Oral epithelium - faces oral cavity
sulcular epithelium - faces the tooth without being in contact w/ the enameel
junctional epithelium - in contact w/ tooth gingiva; always histologically have junctional epithelium

Oral epithelium
- covvers the crest, thee outer surface of th emarginal gingiva and attached gingiva
- it is keratinized = stratified squamous keratinized epithlium
	- does not have blood veessels
	- 2mm of kreatinized tissues maintains teeth health -normal teeth/teeteh with crowns/ with implants (needs more ekereatinized tissue)
- Variations of kereatinization
	- palate - most keratinized
	- gingiva
	- ventral aspeect of the tongue
	- cheks

4 stratums:
1) statum basale
2) stratum spinosum
3) stratum granulosum
4) stratum corneeum
principlal cell: keratinocyte

keratinocyte comef rom base, looses organelles, becomese flat

from base to out - takes 21 days  for healing- SRPs.  - crown lengthening and graftings - wait 4-6 weeks minimum; (3 months ideally but not at school)

- Differentiation involvese the process of **keratinization**
- biochemical and morphological changes of the cell asi tmigrates from nteh basal layer
- this changes include
	- flattening of the cell as it moves
	- disappeance of the nucleus
	- production of keratohyaline granules

periodontal epithelium: a newly recognized role in health and disease modified from dale BA

Langherans cells - defense cells
melanocytes - pigments
merkel cells - pressure, texture

Cell population:
- keratinocytes (90%)
-the other 10%:
- Melanocytes
- langerhans cells
- merkel cells
- inflammatory cells 

Melanocytes
- synthesize meelanin and give color to the gum (melanosomes)
- langherans cells
	- immune reactions as antigen presenting cells to lymphocytes
- merkel cells
	- identified as tactile receptors - temperature, pressure

-The epithelium is joined ot the underlying connective titssue by a basal lamina
-the basal lamina consists of lamina lucida and lamina densa
-The lamina lucida immediately beneath basal cells
-Lamina densa composed of **collagen I (gingival fibers, inside collagen tissue bone; very important)** IV and joins the connective tissue
- prevotella, etc, has enzymes that destroy collagen

Sulcular epithelium
- nonkeratinized stratified squamous epithelium
	- if u youse modified bass technique, the modified base technique stimulates the tissues and you'll have some degree of keratinization in areas where bristles reach
	- after periodontal tissues are healed, you can use stillman and the tissues will return to normal nonkeratinized
- from the coronal portion of the junctional epithelium to the crest of the gingival margin
- it lacks granulosum and corneum stratum
- acts as a semipermeable membrane through which bacterial products pass into the gingiva and tissue fluid to the sulcus.

Junctional epithelium
- collar-like band of stratified squamous nonkeratinizing epithelium
- the length ranges from 0.25 to 1.35mm
- constituted by 10 to 20 layers of cells
- its completely restored after instrumentation
- has something similar in implants but its not exactly juntional epithelium; sort of a biological seal
- no Junctional epithelium nor pdl in implants
- attached to the tooth surface by means of an internal basal lamina
- attached to the gingival connective tissue by means of external basal lamina
- connected to tooth by hemidesmosomes - attach the cells to the internal basal lamina on th etooth surface
- attaches to acellular cementum in the crown, usually to the area within 1mm of the CEJ

Crevicular Fluid
- comes from the gingival connective tissue through sulcular epithelium
- it is believed to:
	- cleanse material from the sulcus
	- to contain plasma proteins that may improve adhesion of the epithelium (junctional epithelium) to the tooth
	- possess antimicrobial properties - alllows defense cells to enter sulcus
	- exert antibody activity to defend gingiva

- calculus has a radius of 3mm of reach of bacteria/toxins; so a tiny calculus will have 3mm ranges
- the attachment of the junctional epithelium to the tooth is reinforced by the gingival fibers
- gingival fibers = brace the marginal gingival against the tooth surfcae
- junctional epithelium + gingival fibers = **dentogingival unit**

the pdl is made of large collagen fibers
- prukin
- **sharpey's fibers**

0.2mm pdl in adult

surrounding the root of eachtooth is a specialized epithlium known as a:


surrounding the root of each tooth:
- juncitonal epithelium
most abundant in the PDL (has all the cells below but most abundant is fibroblasts)
- **fibroblasts**
- osteoblasts
- cementoblasts
- osteoclasts

supragingival plaque:
a) is unattached or loosely adherent
b) is dominated by anaerobes
c) acquirees nutrition from saliva and host diet in the oral cavity

Gingival Connective Tissue
- pdl considered a specialized connective tissue
- is the major tissue in the gingiva and periodontal igament
- its components
	- cells (5%)
	- collagen fibers (60% of the volume)
	- blood vessels
	- nerves (35%)
	- intercellular matrix

Cell population
- fibroblasts  (65%)
- mast cells (heparin and histamine)
- macrophages (in during inflammation)
- neutrophils (defense)
- plasma cells (antibiody reaction)
- lymphocytes (defense)

Intercellular matrix:
(ground substance)
- fills the space b/w cells and collagen fibers
- is amorphous and has a high content of water
- contains
	- proteoglycans
		- hyaluronic acid
		- chondroitin sulfate
	- glycoproteins
		- fibronectin
		- laminin

fibronectin bind fibroblassts to collagen fibers
laminin attaches epithelial cell to basal membrane
CT has 3 types of fibers
1. collagen
	1. type 1
		1. gives tensile strength to gingival tissue
	2. type IV (branches between type I and around blood vessels)
2. reticular
3. non... oxystalan fiber
	oxytalan fibers are found in the PDL
	- nore numerous an ddense in the cervical region
	- elaunin fbers are found in gigiva
	- they run vertically from teh cementum around the root and termninate at apex
Fibers
- they consist of collagen type I
- the fiber bundles are capable to adapt stress
gingival fibers
functions:'
1. to brace the marginal gingiva firmly against the tooth
2. to provide the rigidity to withdstand forces of mastication without being deflected from the surface
3. to unite the free gingiva to cementum and adjacent attached gingiva
gingival fiber groups
1) dentogingival group
	1) the most NUMEROUS GROUP
	2) FROM CERVICAL CEMENTUM TO FREE AND ATTACHED GINGIVA
2) ALVEOLOGINGIVAL GROUP
	1) from alveolar crest into attached and free gingiva
...

Principal fibers (periodontal fibers)
11) alveolar crest group
12) horizontal group
13) oblique group
14) interradicular group
15) apical group

intercellular matrix
- is an amorphous material that binds tissue and fluids
- 70% water
- produced mostly by fibroblasts
- function:
	- transport of water, electrolytes, nutrients, cell products between CT and cells
