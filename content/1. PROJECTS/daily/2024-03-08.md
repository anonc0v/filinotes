oral cancer
- high mortality and morbiditiy
- low 5 yr survival rate 50%
- >90% squamous cell carcinomas (from surface epithelium > minor changes in mucosa can be observed, so early diagnosis is possible)
- oral potentially maligant disorders in a significant number of cases (30%)

oral ancer
- squamous cell carcinoma (approx 90% of cases)
- lymphoproliferative disorders
	- many develop after existing conditions like epstein-barr
- adenocarcinomas
- sarcinomas
- melanomas
- metastases

High risk locations for oral cancer
-"horseshoe shape area of cancer"
- lateral obrders of the tongue
- floor of the mouth
- lower lip (vermilion)
- gingia

Oral cancer risk factors
- exposure to carcinogenic agents
	- tobacco
	- alcohol
	- UV radiation
	- chemical substances
	- infectious agents (HPV (potentially major risk in younger population - for tonsillar tissues oropharyngeal tissues) EBV, HS, etc.)

Theoretical formula for oral cancer

Initiating agent (carcinogen) + Promotor (Co-carcinogen) + Susceptibility +  Time
**Tobacco** + **Alcohol/Chronic irritation**. + **Immunosuprression/Genetic basis** + **Years**
-Genetic basis is the most important factor

Tobacco and oral cancer
- increased incidence of oral cancer in people that consume smoking tobacco (cigarette,e pipe, cigar and other forms of tobacco in combustion)
- Incidence of oral cancer in consumres of non smoking tobacco (tobacco chewing, snuff, etc.) is higher than iobserved in non-consumers.

Alcoholism and oral cancer
- dehydration of the mucosa
- release of own carcinogens
- liver damage with deecreased ability to remove carcinogens
- atrophy of the mucosa, secondary to metabolic alterations

Case 1:
- oral ulceration in lateral border of tongue covered by thick fibrin membrane
- it is hard
- 4 month duration
- from these 3, it potentially can be squamous cell carcinoma
- but lets look at other features
	- atrophic tongue
	- pale tongue
- so there must be some other reason
- liver cirrhosis

Infectious agents associated with oral cancer
- treponema pallidum
- candida albicans
- herpes virus (HS I and IIm ,EBV)
- HIV
- HPV subtypes 16 and 18

Clinical features suggestive of oral cancer
- proliferation (tumoral growth)
- infiltration (adherence to adjacent tissues)
- ulceration

Case 2:
- 2 months duration
- no assoc to trauma
- bump on lateral border of tongue
- there was infiltrationm, slight ulceration

Classification
- we can control only T1 cases
- we have to use other diagnostic tools when the lesion is >T1

Patients dont die from oral cancer they die from metastases

goes to lymph nodes, then to lungs

1st site of distal metastases of oral cancers = Lungs, so chance of developing pneumonia is high because the TB can infect the carcinoma in the lung; they willl die more likely of pneumonia

Oral cancer of lower lip
- survival rate is high
- lower rate of metastases

oral cancer
- frequency of metastastis according to size of tumor
- size / % metastasis
- 0-2 cm / 34%
- 2.1-3.5cm 58%
- >3.5 cm 80%

5 yr survival
- lesions treated w/o metastasis - 70% 
- Lesions treated when existing metastasis - 25%

actinic cheilitis - precancerous lesion

oral cel squamous carcinoma has very low rate of metastases, but you should still do a sentinel exploration of the lymph nodes to make sure; its an immunological test to see if there are micrometastases and if metastases is found, then radiotherapy. (treatment of oncologist)

How can we reduce its incidence?
How can we improve its prognosis?
-Recognize it in time and reduce the risk
-Early diagnosis, proper treatment and control

70% SCC occurs in "clinically normal mucosa"
"moleculary altered mucosa that is not evident clinically"

Nowadays, there are some genetic studies that can determine one's risk for OSCC

so 30% of SCC occur in clinically altered mucosa 
- presence of oral potentially malgingant disorders such as
	- white patch, called a Leukoplakia

A biopsy can revewal epiethlial dysplasia.
Some of the white patch 1-2% will develop OSCC; the risk of developing OSCC Is higher in the white patches than normal

Microscopic structure of oral mucosa
-squamous cell  epithelium
-Lamina propria

Early alterations (visible in microscope) known as precursors in at least 30% of oral SCC
- syskeratosis/hyperkeratosis
- cellular atipia celular/architectural changes)
-Called Epithelial dysplasia - like atypia, etc

Disseination of osscc in the oral mucosa
once in lamina propria, can easily go to lymph vessels and produce metastasis, can reach the periosteum of the bone and then spread to bone

RAS does not affect gingiva?

Precancerous lesion
- a tissue altered in its morphology, in which the risk of malignan transofrmation is higher than in its apparently normal counterpart
-WHO 1973

Most common precancerous condition/lesion: Leukoplakia
Oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMD)

Oral potentially malignant disorders
- leukoplakia
- erythroplakia
- other (Submucous fibrosis, PVL (proliferative vererucous leukoplakia), Lichen planus, Licheenoid leseions, GVHD)
- leuk and ery = 95% of all 

OPMD
- leukoplakia
	- it is a preedominantly white, non removable oral mucosal patch, which can not be echarcterized clinically as many known disease. some of these transform into squamous cell carcinoma.
	- J oral pathol med 1996: 25:49-54

-oral dis. 2021 nov

White lesions of the oral mucosa
Due to:
- epithelial increase in thickness as a response to physical, chemical or immunological agents
	- can lead to production of keratin and combined with the humidity of the mouth, will turn white)
- genetic disorders related to keratin prdouction and developmeent 
	- like white sponge nevus???
- overproduction of keratin as part of a phenomenon of malignant neoplastic trnasformation of the surface epithelium 

Linea alba buccalis
- Diagnostic clue: Lineal lesion along the dental occlusion

Morsicatio buccarum (cheek biting)
- Diagnostic clue: Lesions only occur in areas susceptible of biting

Frictional keratosis
- white patches related to chronic trauma
- may start as white patch on lateral border of tongue
- do not produce dysplasia on the microscopic level
- Diagnositc clue
- - lesions associated w/ an obvious traumatic factor. they gradually dissapear (1-2 months) when the cause is removed or corrected

Leukodema
- whitening of buccal mucosa, which diseappears when you stretch the mucosa (b/c theres a increase in thickness of mucosa due to inc glycogen content within the cytoplasm of the cells)
- normal variant of oral mucosa
- more common in persons w/ dark skin but that's not true; 
- Diagnositc clue
-Whitening is due to thickening of th epeithlium because of intraepithelial glycogen accumulation. when the muocsa is pulled, the appearnace of th ewhite veil dissapears, only to re-form when placed in normal position.

White sponge nevus
-Diagnostic clue
- lesions in other mucosal surfaces (nasal, esophagus, genitals). They appear early in childhood. As it is a genetic autosomal dominant disorder, may be found in other mevbmers of the fmaily.  cytology and histopathology confirm diagnosis b
-congential dyskeratosis can look the same but is limited only to oral mucosa;  but if it affects other mucosas it is white sponge nevus 
-in cytological smears, we can confirm diagnosis of white sponge nevus

# Lichen planus and lichenoid lesions
-white papules that occurs over hematose mucosa, and they fuse together to make lines, normally bilatearl; 
-is a muco-cutaneous disorder characterized variably by oral, genital and/or skin lesions
affects approx. 1% adult population
F>M
Clinical findings:
- predominance of asymptomatic reticular pattern
- multiple lesions (bilateral), mainly in buccal mucosa, tongue (lateral), gingiva and lips
- friction (trauma) favors new lesions
- erosive type main cause of consultation (because there is pain)
- some plaque-like lesions may simulate leukoplakia, and therefore biopsy is mandatory
Etiology:
- occurs in the interface b/w epithelium and connective tissue; there is an immunologic mediated response in the antigen, which is located in the eptihelium
- the epithelial cells produce substances in response to medication or substances int he oral cavity
- and these substances become an antigen; the t-lymphocytes attack the basal cells of the epithelium and produces inflammation, which produces the redneess, then the epithelium attacked by the immune cells become thinner; to prevent rupture, the epithelial produce keratin that spreads over the mucosa
- if there is trauma, the lesion extends over the area of the trauma
- thats bwhy most are located in the biting area
- ther eis a reticular pattern, atrophic pattern, and erosive pattern
- looks like ?OSCC  but oes not have infiltration or proliferation
- some transform into OSCC, though

Diagnostic criteris of lichen planus based on previous proposals (warnakulasuriya et al)

Lichen planua
etiolopathogenesis:
- most cases are idiopathic 
- focal upregulation of BM proteins and epithelial secretion of cytokines (TNF-a, IL-1) facilitates ingress of t-lymphocytes that attack epithelium (auto-cytotoxic cd8+) t-cells trigger basal cell apoptosis via TNF-a
	- tx: use topical agents to reduce activity of t-lymphocytes, thats why treated with corticosteroids

took pic 9:34
white - vacuolization
red - apoptosis
parakeratinization on surface

Lichenoid lesion
- eliminate possible allergenic agents

Risk of malignant transformation is lower in lichen planus than lichenoid

# lichen planus
- cytologicla clues:
- - lichen planus lesions may occur in skin, mnails and other mucosas in 30#
- oral lichenoid lesions are usually related to dental materials (amalgam, etc), drugs (antihypertensives ) or some systemic diseases such as C hepatitis or GVHD.
- histology does not defferentiate among them 

Treatment:
- confirm diagnosis by biopsy
- improve oral hygiene an deliminate sharp borders and other irritating factors
- rx in case of periodontal compromise
- exclude/contro l predisopising factors/diseases
- start topical steroids/tacrxolimus according to case; also add antifungal therapy b/c most are secondarily infected by candida
- prevent or treat candidosis

Treatment:
- reticular: usually none
- mild symptomatic: topical (potent) steroids
- antifungals may be useful
- widespread erosive lesions: systemic steroids in tappering dose scheme
- localized painful lesions: intralesional corticosteroids

management of gingival lesions:
- vacuum formed splint to apply potent topical steroids (gel or ointment) 2-3 times a day (10 mninutes each time) e.g. clobetasol propionate
- reduce use according to response
- complement periodontal therapy

Maintenance:
- good oral hygiene
- diet rich in fruits an dvegetables
- avoid triggering factors
- topical steroids in case of persistent or new localized lesions
- the diecision of stopping treatment will depend on the response and course of the disease

Clinicopathological and prognostic characterization of oral lichenoid disease and its main subtypes: a series of 384 cases
aguirre jose manuel
- LPO (oral lichenoid planus) 77.9%
- LLO (oral lichenoid lesions) 33%
-malignant transformation occurs in all the group, which 1.6% belong to oral lichen planus, and 5.9% are from oral lichenoid lesions

in hyperkeratotic lesion we want to determine if there is epithelial dysplasia or not to determine the treatment

Precancerous lesions - Therapeutic approach
- No dysplasia: 'Supress potentially etiologic factors and confirm regression of the lesion
- Mild/moderate ED: Elimnination of possible etiologic factors. Close follow-up. If no regression is observed after 6 months re-biopsy or remove in toto.

**In recent classification 2022 by WHO**, pathologists classified all groups of dysplasia into broad groups
- originally mild dysplasia now is called low grade
- moderate dysplasia/severe dysplasia is now high-grade dysplasia
- Severe ED/Ca in situ: Complete removal and long-term follow-up to detect early any possible recurrence. It is mandatory to control possible predisposing/promoting agents.

Case 
- idiopathic leukoplakia
- non-honogenous leukoplakia
- remove epithelium then 10 months took care of chief complaint with inplant
- tongue

proliferative verrucous leukoplakia
- louis hansen; 1985
Mujeres > 65 years old - no tabacco
- multifocal lesions
- growing horizontally and irreversible
- resistent to treatment (27/28 recurrent)
- recurrent
- developed malignancy eventually
- named PVL

Diagram showing natural evolution and the various stages of disease (greer 1999)

PVL - follow-up study of 54 cases - silverman
- 70.3% of malignant tranformation from PVL to squamous cell carcinoma
- most grequent site is gingiva and tongue
- high mortality rate
- 21/54 died of PVL-associated carcinoma

PVL may initially mimic lichenoid reactions
-marcio 2015
- this is why a biopsy is recommended for LICHENOID reactions
- but for lichen planus, not always.

Benign reactive and neoplastic lesions of the oral mucosa
tunoral growths of the oral mucosa
- possible etiology
	- chronic inflammation
	- reactive hyperplasias
	- cysts
	- malformations
	- benign and malignant neoplasms
	- sytemic diseases with storage of ..
- predojinant cliinical image
	- firm, non hemorrhagic tumors
	- soft, hemorrhagic tumors
	- pauplar and verruco-papillary growths
	- fluctuant submucous growths
-
Firm, non hemorrhagic tumors
- fibrous hyperplasia (traumatic fibroma)
- fibrous epulis (gingival fibroma)

Fibrous hyperplasia (traumatic fibroma)
- the most frequent tumor of the oral mucosa
- no gender predilection
- incidence increases with age
- evidence of trauma in most cases
- asymptomatic and slowkly growing lesionmore common on buccal mucosa, tongue, gingiva and lips

Fibromas - normally pedunculated (narrow base, in which the growth of connective titssue is outwards from the mucosa; may also occur on tongue, normally localized but sometimes multiple in cases where there are multiple areas of trauma)

epulis - related to gingival tissues
fibrous epulis
-presence or absence of bone within the fibrous hyperplasia located in the gingiva with cleaning of the root or surgical bed to avoid leaving part of the lesion
- has bone b/c arises from the PDL, which contans cells that can make bone

Denture hyperplasia (epulis fissuratum)
- due to traumatic frction caused by a prothesis
- one or more mucosal folds that surrounds a removable prothesis and develops some fissures
- slowly growing and asymptomatic
- more common in anterior region
- chronic inflammation omay produce bone atrophy
- more common in fmeale patients

other non haermorrhagic tumoral growths
benign neoplasma:
- peripheral nerve
- fibroblastic/myofibroblastic
- smooth muscle
- striated muscle
- salivary gland tumors

Neurofibromatosis (von recklinghausen disease)
- autosomal dominant inheritance
- relatively common (1/3000 births)
- 50% are spontaneous mutations
- papules, nodules or large tumoral masses that may be present at brith or devlop later
- Cafe au lait macules (>6)

oral lesions are common (4%-92%), mainly on the tongue, buccal mucosa and intra-bony
- fungiform papillae enlargementj
- approx. 5% may transform in sarcomas (highly malignant, so must send for biopsy)
- surgical treatment indicated in those cases that may affect functions, and because of the risk of malignant transformation

11 years old, lesion
- present since eruption of tooth
- 5 years since eruption of central, so 4 years 
- has also intraoral presentation
- multiple cafe au lait macules

case 
- nodule in tongue
- lipoma
- neurofibromas are not well-defined
- neoplasm of nerve tissue
- isolated neoplasm
- neurofibroma / schwannoma (can arive from IAN, and others)

Lipomas
- may grow to larger size
- floats in formaldehyde

Generalized gingival overgrowth
etiologic possibilities:
- chronic hyperplastic gingivitis
- drug induced GGO
- idiopathic GGO
- hereditary (syndromic) ggo

Associated drugs:
- hydantoins (dilantin, epamin)
- calcium channel blockers: nifedipine, diltiazem, verapamil, felodipine and other
- dihidropiridines: amlodipine, bleomycin and other
- immunosupresor drugs: cyclosporin A

Hereditary gingival overgrowth
- may affect solely the gingiva or be associated to several syndromes:
	- hypertricosis lanuginosa syndrome - hirsutism; may have hair all over body
- etc

Soft haemorrhagic (red) tumoral growths
- pyogenic granuloma
- peripheral giant cell granuloma
- vascular malformations
- vascular neoplasms
