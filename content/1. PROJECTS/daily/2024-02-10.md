 PULP is not a nerve, it's a tissue composed of: (5mL per tooth)
 - microvasculature
	 - vasodilatation
	 - inc. permeability
	 - chemical mediators
	 - leukocyte migration
 - sensorial acttivity
	 - mastocyte degranulation
	 - nutrient interruption
	 - tissue damage
	 - chemical mediators

Damage to pulp causes
- mast cells degranulation
- broken vessels
- tissue damage
- nervous stimulation
Leading to release of 
- histamines/
- 5-ht (serotonin)/
- kinins/
- PGs (prostaglandins)/
- PS (substance P)
Which leads to
- pain (nerves)
- vasodilatation (arterioles)
- extravasation (venules)
- chemotaxis (leukocytes)

- a periapical lesion forms when leukocytes are called; the lesion is formed by the body to hold back the infection from entering systemic circulation;
- but when the lesion goes from chronic to acute bacteria will be present in the lesion as well, namely porphyromonas and prevotella

Present in an infected pulp:
gas 
granulation tissue
pus
dead bacteria
defense cells, dead and alive
On hot days:
- gas >>> expansion >>> pressure >>> Pain

presence of systemic symptoms or presence of trismus will prompt the need for antibiotics so that swelling is reduced
- trismus - can't open mouth, so you can't treat
- swelling 

ibuprofen, acetaminophen
