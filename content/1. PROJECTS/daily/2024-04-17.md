# Chemical Plaque Control

"Mechanical removal of dental plaque remains the gold standard for gingival health."

- SG plaque control should be considered a "sanitary" procedure that lowers bacteria
- SG treatment affects both, the numbers and the composition of the microbiota
- a good chemical agent should inhibit at least 80% of the plaque 

# [[1. PROJECTS/Dentistry/Dental Materials/Chlorhexidine|Chlorhexidine]]
- Today, the only one that achieves those results is [[1. PROJECTS/Dentistry/Dental Materials/Chlorhexidine|Chlorhexidine]] (CHX); a better option is sodium hypochlorite but you can't wash your mouth with that
- Chlorhexidine was used in the war to clean wounds; it was not specifically made for dentistry 
- Diguanidohexane with antiseptic properties
- 10mL of chlorhexidine at 0.2% almost completely inhibits development:
	- plaque
	- calculus
	- gingivitis
- Local reversible effects:
	- brawn staining of teeth
	- tongue
	- resins
- Low systemic toxic activity in humans
- has not produced local resistance or oral microorganisms
- has not been associated w/ any teratogenic effects 
- chlorhexidine is used along with mycotic agents to treat candidiasis
- contains 12% of alcohol
	- causes dryness
	- difficult to hold it in mouth for 1 minute b/c of burning
	- if product doesn't remain in contact for a specific time, it will not work
- There is no evidence of oropharyngeal cancer because of associated with alcohol 
- The effect of chemical substances are categorized in 4:
- 1. Anti-adhesives
- 2. antimicroiaal
- 3. plaque eliminators
- 4. anti-apathogenics

## Anti-adhesives 
- act over the superficial pellicle avoiding initial fixation of bacteria 
- Supposed to work better over a clean dental surface
- too toxic to be used in mouth and inefficient over dental plaque 
- They can inhibit plaque formation through 2 mechanisms:
	- 1. Inhibition of bacterial proliferation (primary bacteria)
	- Bacteriostatic effect (avoids formation of posterior colonies)
	- 2. Bactericidal effect 
		- destroys all microorganisms already adhered or in process
		- for plaque the effect should be absolute and persistent
		- most pellicles are resistant to bactericidal effect 
		- there is no product that sterilizes tooth surface 
- may destroy also the "useful" bacteria in the mouth 

## Plaque eliminators 
- the idea is to create a substance that acts as a dental brush
- it is supposed to reach every tooth surface 
- investigations.....

## Anti-pathogenic 
- they are thought to eliminate the pathogenic expression of bacteria 
- no advance in this subject b/c it was very toxic 

## Dentrifices 
Main Ingredients
Abrasives
- dicalcic phosphate, calcium carbonate
- they help to control extrinsic stains 
Detergents 
- the most used is sodium lauryl sulfate - wait 20 minutes before using chlohexidine b/c it lowers the efficacy of chlorhexidine
- responsible for the foam formation  
Sweeteners
- saccharine 

## Mouthwashes
- most of the plaque chemicals are mouthwashes 
- alcohol is used to improve the duration of the product on the stores 
- most of the products have up to 10% of alcohol 
- the relationship between alcohol and oral cancer has not been established 
Oral-B: Enjuage Bucal para Gingivitis (color purple) 
How much liquid to use?
10-15mL; but just say use cap, don't fill all the way 
## Spray 
- they can be pointed to a certain area 
- well used, they are as effective as mouthwashes 
- specially useufl for old age and disabled patients 
- they stain teeth and tongue equally as the mouthwashes 
- usually made of [[1. PROJECTS/Dentistry/Dental Materials/Chlorhexidine|Chlorhexidine]]
Brand in school: Bexident: EncÃ­as

Directions for CHX is the same for spray, mouthwash, gel: 
20 min after brushing
20 min without eating / drinking 

Classification of mouthwashes 
- insert chart here 

Group|Substance|Action|Product 
-----|----|-------|-----|
Diguanidohexane |(CHX) q 12 hrs | Antimicrobial | mouthwash, gel toothpaste, spray
---|----|----|----
Quaternary ammonium compounds | Cetylpyridinium chloride (3-5 hrs) | Mouthwash
----|----|---|----
Essential oil (Triclosan Eucalyptol) q 5 hours | Mouthwash, toothpaste 

Cetylpryidinium Chloride 
mouthwashes:
Oral-B 
Pro-salud (blue bottle)
Oral-B 
Pro-salud Noche  (gray bottle)
-exactly same except different concentration; studies do not support one more effective than other 

Brand names for CHX products 
mouthwash 
1. Bexident EncÃ­as Colutorio (0.20%)
2. Perioxidin (0.12%)
3. Oral-B Gingivitis  (0.12%)
4. KIN gingival  (0.12%) - also a gel version; tiny coat over area - they'll feel it all over eventually bc of saliva and they have to talk, etc. but it works by adhesion so its ok
5. Periogard (Colgate) (0.12%) - cheaper, better taste, not easy to be found in mexico

Directions:
- Mouth rinses twice a day for 15 days 
- without dilution 
	- Brushing
	- 15-20 minutes wait 
	- Mouthwash 
	- 10-15 minutes without eating or drinking 

Characteristics of an agent for plaque control 
- The product must to have substantivity = capacity to remain active for a period of time
- works by Retention: over the dental surfaces = be careful with restorations! resin/porcelain/etc 
- antimicrobial activity: for primary colony formers 
- minimum neutralization by bacteria and their products 

Toxicity, safety and secundary effects 
- no teratogenic or gastric effects if ingested on animal models 
- has wide antibacterial action against gram negative and positives 
- also effective against yeasts, fungal infection (candida) and viruses (HIV and HBV)
- no reports of bacterial resitance or fungal ... 

Side Effects 
1. staining of the teeth (brown), some restoration materials and/or tongue 
2. Taste alterations (decrease of salty taste)
3. Erosion of the oral mucosa (appears to be dose dependent) 
look in ppt. 

Uses 
... look in ppt 
- patient with predisposition for infections 
	- useful against candida (along with nystatin, amphotericin B)
	- patients under radio therapy

- patients with high risk for caries 
	- against streptococcus mutans
	- use one 1week per month 
- as mouthwash before surgery 
	- used immediately before SRP with ultrasound 
	- used before surgery

-0.12-0.2% 
-same effect 
-twice a day for 15 days 

Gel - make sure it says Bexident EncÃ­as b/c there are different kinds 
-0.1-0.2% 
-can be used w/ brush or dental tray 
-useful after surgery 

Red - something to do with bleeding/gums 
pink - something to do with hypersensitvity 
blue - for healthy patients; for maintenance 

Parodontax - toothpaste w/ chlorhexidine 
- still has same side-effects 

Periodecks 

displacement - movement of flap coronally, lataerally, apically
