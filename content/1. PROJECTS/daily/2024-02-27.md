#pedo/class   

Frankl behavioral rating scale
1: definitely negative (--) - selladores (sealants), limpieza, fluoride, varnish, ART
- refusal of treatment, forceful crxying, fearfulness or any other overt evidence of extreme negativism
- 5yo - bugs in mouth that are biting (injection)
 **non-invasive procedures**
	- sealants
	- cleaning
	- fluoride
2: Negative (-)
Reluctance to accept treatment, uncooperativeness, some evidence of negative attitude but no pronounced (sullen, withdrawn).
3: Positive (+)
- Acceptance of treatment; cautious behavior at times, willingness to comply with the dentist, at times w/ reservation, but patient follows the dentist's directions cooperatively
4: Definitely positive (++) - 7 yo
- good rapoprt w/ dentist, interest in the dental procedures, laughter and enjoyment.

conscious sedation techniques
Sedation 
- nitrous oxide
- oral sedation
General Anesthesia

Factors for succesfull behavior Control
- proper use of non pharmacologic dental techniques.
- Anesthesia technique 

Fundamentals of behavior management
-dental health team effectively and efficiently performs

1) positive approach: the attitude or expectations of the dentsist can affect the outcome of dental papointment
2) team attitude: personality factors such as warmth and interest that can be conveyed without a spoken word are critical when dealing w/ children

- a major difference b/w the treatment of childrenn and tx of adults is the relationship
- treating adults generally involves a 1 to 1 relationship, that is, a dentist-px relationship
- ...

- Management methods acceptable to society and the litigiousnness of society have been factors influencing treatment modalities.

Environment
- toys in office

Classification of Techniques for behavior control
Nonpharmacologic techniques:
- tell-show-do
- positive reinforcement
- modeling
- voice control
- papouse board, net,
- hand over mouth

Pharmacologic techniques
- conscious sedation: NOS, Benzodiazepine, etc.
- General Anesthesia
	- Scale: Stage 1 through 4
		- Stage 3 is what you want (Stage of Surgical Anesthesia)

# conscious sedation techniques 
## Tell Show Do (modification; do Show - Do again w/in 5 seconds after doing)
1. Describe the procedure
2. Show instruments how it will be
3. do it in the patients hand
4. do it in the patient's mouth slowly
Knee-to-Knee technique
- distal of 1st primary molar
- floss starting at 3 years old 

rubber dam = baloon
- move your hand and talk at same time

## Positive reinforcement
- Reinforcements
- reicnforce positive actions
- giving gifts to children as a reward.  if the gift has dental significance a9such as toothbrush kit), so much the better. - AFTER the appointment
6 yo - baloon
8 yo - NO baloon

## Modeling
- Learn behavior from atitude of parents, classmates, etc.
- helpful in dental office if there is another child being treated

## voice control
- talk to patient in a soft tone of voice
- in this way, the patient fells secure and confident and follow instructions
- the objective is to communicate

bring face mirror to show just for few seconds what you do in their mouth

## Hand over mouth
- The behavior modification method of aversive conditioning is known as hand-over-mouth exercise = HOME (levitas, 1974)
- - its purpose is to gain the attention of highly oppositional child so that communication can be established and cooperation obtained 
- children 3 to 6 years of age who have appropriate communicative abilities

## knee to knee

![[knee-to-knee.jpg]]- depends on patient; 2 to 5 years old

## Restrictive Methods 
- ### Papoose Board
	- child can't move, it avoids injuries
	- cooperation is worst afteeer for the future
### Net-Macri
- restrictive meethod
- child can move, it avoids injuries
	
remember 3/4 conscious techniques

Strategies for the dnetal team

Communicating w/ Children
- several effective communication techniques can be suggested
- thsee key points are guidelines, not inflexible rules
Tehse successes can be attributed to a nuber of factors such as:
- a ptient's confident personality
- a parent's proper preparation of the child for the appointment
- a dental team's excellent communicative skills

word substituttes for explaining procedures to children
- Rubber dam = raincoate
- rubber dam clamp = tooth button 
- rubber dam frame = coat rack
- sealant = tooth paint
- topical fluoride gel = cavity fighter
- air syringe = wind gun
- water syringe = water gun
- suction = vacuum cleaner

Advice
- do not lie to the children
- show and explain the truth in a different way
- discipline the pedo patient in the office

Local anesthesia
- the bugs will run and they will bite, then i'll wash it with water
	- pinch hannd or lip

# Local anestthetic in Children and pain control
- one of the most important aspects of child behavior guidance is the control of pain
- if children experience pain during restorative or surgical procedures, their future as dental patients may be damaged

- there are many pharmacologic pain control strategies to help chidren cope with situations, both pre an dpostoperatively
- dental procedures can be carried out more effectively if child is comfortable and pain free
- injection produces greatest negative response in children

Purpose of anesthesia
adults: patient comfort >> clinician comfot
pedo: patient comfort >>> behavior management >>> clinician comfort

Differences b/w pediatric patient/ adult patient
- **psychologic**: modify the anesthesia technique
- **anatomic**: modifty the anesthesia technique
- **metabolism** - size and weight
	- modify the quantity of anesthesia

# Psychological differences
- the child has a limited ability to management his or her fear
	- being alone w/ doctor, needles..
- they need to explore freely the things around them
- they are not patient 
	- you hav elimited period of time
	
# anatomic differences
- smaller structure - use smaller needle
- immature bone - better diffusion of the solution
- entrance of lower mandibular canal - different point for the injection

# dosage
- different weight and fat proportion, change the amonnt of anesthesia
- weight x dosage per kilogram = individual dosage

**6 years old

20kg x 4.4mg/kg lidoaina = 88mg

1 cartridge has 36mg of lidocaine, for mepivicaine 54mg, for articaine 72mg

mg/mg per cartridge = # of cartridges
88mg/36mg per cartridge = 2.44 cartridges

*age* x 2 + 8 = patient weight. from 2 to 10 years old.

Composite
- 1/2 cartridge per tooth
- 1 cartridge 2 teeth
Pulpotomy/pulpectomy - 1 - 1/2 cartridge
Crowns - 1-1/2
extraction - 1-1/2
surgery:
- frenectomy: 1-2
- cyst removal: 

to be safer, -30% from max dose
so if max dose is 2.44, 30% = 1.7 cartridge

mental emotional age
- 0-3. cant do behavior management
	- patient unable to understand
	- emergencies: physical restriction techniques, sedation, general anesthesia
- 3-5yo difficult 
	- patient able to understand, curious
	- still believe in fairy tales
	- very curious
- 6-9 yo
	- almost always
	- almost always
	- curious, able to understand
	- dont believe in fairy tails
- 9-12
	- almost always
	- curious, able to understand
	- dont believe in fairy tails

Behavior management
- discipline the patient (put their hands behind their back), parents wait outside
- explain the procedure (bear in mind the age of the patinet)
	- remember the basic non-pharmacological techniques:
		- voice tonrol, tell show do: distraction, desensitizing, imitation, positive reinforcement
	- start w/ upper-bucal area. (painless)
- **the patient doesn't need to see the needle**, just show the cartridge and the topical anesthesia

most painful anesthesia areas
1) palatal
2) upper anterior
3) block/ lower posterior. vestibular (if you touch periosteum)
4) infiltration upper buccal. 

Topical anesthesia
- reduce the sligth discomfort that. mya be asociated w/ i nsertion of the needle b4 the injection of. the l ocal anesthetic
- are avilable in gel, liquid, ointment and pressurized pray forms

topical anesthesia
- most recommended: benzocaine gel 20%
1. dry mucosa
2. apply topical anesthetic (1 minute at least)
forms:
- gel 
- aerosol
- liquid
- patch

computer systems
-  allow pressure control

local anesthesia by conventional injection
- trapp and davies reported positive aspiration through 23, 25, 27, 30 gauge. needles w/o clinicallys ignificant difference in. resistance to flow

- [ ] buy cheap dark glasses, spiderman, flowers, for pedo patient

Regardless of zie of. needle used, anesthetic solution should be injected slowly and dthe dentist should watch the patient closely. for any evidence of an unexpected reaction.
- 1 minute per cartridge

temperature
- heat the cartridge
- less painful for patient
- can be heated w/ machine OR.  by holding in hand for a few minutes
