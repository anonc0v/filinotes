beta agonist relaxation of blood vessels

used to have asthma > still consider asthmatic reaction

chronic inflammatory lung disease

skin reactions = allergy

when there is rupture of alveolar sacs, you get pulmonary emphysema

managements
put oximeter on finger for asthmatic patients
do not prescribe NSAIDs - bronchospasm
ask patient to bring their medication
there is no contraindication w/ epinephrine; however, preservatives (sodium metabisulfite) can axacerbate asthma
place the bronchodilator next to you
afternoon appointments - depends on patients
avoid aspirin, NSAIds; more like mimimize >>> bronchospasm

prevent crisis with oximeter <90% oxygen
no more than 3 disparos (shots) of the 

Medical Treatment for Allergy: ABCD
Antihistamines 
Bronchodilator (B-agonist)
Corticosteroids
Decongestant

also montelukast
- association with suicide for long-term mnontelukast use
