# Action Items

# Rheumatoid arthritis
- autoiummune
- women more affected than men 
- hallmark manifestation of RA: rheumatoid nodule 
	- associated with methotrexate treatment
- Oral manifestations:
	- dryness and swelling of salivary glands and often Sjogrens syndrome 
	- anemia 
Differential diagnosis:
- osteoarthritis

# Sjogren's Syndrome 
- autoimmune disease
- women >50 years old 
- destruction of exocrine glands, esp. **salivary and lacrimal glands**
	- also ocular and oral manifestations 
- genetics + triggering factors (like viral infections)
Oral manfiestations 
- reduced salivary flow rate 
- dental erosion and caries 
- xerostomia 
- angular cheilitis
- dry tongue 
- erythematous tongue 
- mouth ulcers

# Lupus Erythematosus 
- Autoimmune disease 
- skin, musculoskeletal, hematologic, and serologic involvement 
- more prevalent in african population
- more prevalent in women 
- Type III hypersensitivity, related to IGG and IGM 
- Clinical manifestations 
	- Malar (butterfly rash)
- Lab tests
	- CBC
	- anti

Dr. Diana:

# Autoimmune Diseases
5-8% of Americans
Oral manifestations are often first sign of these conditions

## Rheumatoid Arthritis 
- chronic inflammatory condition 
- also affects liver, cardiovascular, psychological, and skeletal 
- etiology: unknown
	- genetics + environmental (smoking, infections)

### Pathogenesis
1. edema of the synovium 
	1. occurs, followoed by thickening and folding. marked infiltration fo lymphyocytes and plasma cell sinto the capsule occurs 
2. Eventually, granulation tissue covers the articular surfaces and destroys the cartilage and subchondral bone. 
3. New bone or fibrous tissue then is deposited, resulting in fusion or loss of mobility 

### Diagnostic
- general fatigue
- painful joint swelling 
- joint progresses to immobility, contractures, subluxation, deviation, and other deformities 
- **morning stiffness that lasts longer than 1 hour** 
	- in osteoarthritis, pain occurs when patient uses their hands/joints a lot; does not occur first in the morning 

Criteria
- morning stiffness 
- arthritis of three or more joint cases 
- arthritis of hand points 
- symmetric arthritis 
- rheumatoid nodules 
- serum rhuematoid factor 
- radiographic changes 

Other body systems affected - consider this also during medical questionnaires 
- skeletal muscle 
- skin 
- brain 
- lung
- liver 
- blood vesels 

Oral manifestation 
- **TMJ disorders (pain, difficulty opening, swelling)**
- xerostomia 
- secondary sjogren's syndrome 
- periodontal disease 

Since mobility is a problem, can recommend electric tooth brush 

### Treatment 
- palliative to reduce join inflammation and swelling, relieve pain and stiffness, and facilitate normal function 
- Basic treatment: patient education, rest, exercise, physical therapy, and aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) 
- Disease -modfiying antirheumatic drugs (antimalarial agents, penicilamine, gold compounds) 
- corticosteroids 
- immunosuppressive therapy 

Dental management
1. short appointments 
2. ensurance of physical comfort 
	1. frequent postion changes 
	2. comfortable chair osition 
	3. physical supports as needed (pillows, towels, etc.)
3. drug considerations 
	1. aspirin and NSAIDs- bleeding may be increased but usually is not clinically significant 
	2. gold salts, penicilamine, antimalarials, immunosuppressivess--get complete blood cell count w/ differential, bleeding time; treat stomatitis symptomatically 
	3. corticosteroids--adrenal suppression possible 
4. joint prosthesis--prophylactic antibiotics are suggested by some authors (cephalosporin or clindamycin)
5. technical treatment modification dictated by patient's disabilities 
6. temporamndibular joint pain/dysfunction --sudden occlusal changes possible 
	1. decrease jaw function 
	2. soft, nonchallenging diet 
	3. moist heat or ice to face/jaw 
	4. medication as directed by physician 
	5. occlusal appliance to decrease joint loading 
	6. consideration of surgery for persistent pain or dysfunction 

# Lupus erythematosus 
- SLE is a chronic and complex autoimmune disease with a wide range of presentations from cutaneous to systemic 
- a complex interaction of impaired apoptotic processes, cascade of innate and adaptive immune system interactions, ...

## epidemiology 
- worldwide disease 
- women childbearin age (15-44 yrs) 
- African american women are 3 times more likely to develop 
	- since women have more estrogen. 

## Etiology 
- unknown 
- genetic and environmental factors 
- risk factors: infectious agents, stress, toxins, sunlight 

## diagnosis 
4 of 11 criteria must be met 
- oral lesions are the most common findings 
- check chart for criteria 

### Diagnosis - Cutenaeous lupus 
- raised, delayed and long lasting 

### Diagnosis. - muskuloskeletal 
- joint problems 
- arthralgia and synovitis (90% of cases)

### Diagnosis - renal involvement 

### Diagnosis: Central nervous system 
- seizures, psychosis, 

1. malar rash - butterfly rash 
2. discoid rash - can scar, chronic 
3. photosensitivity - other rashes from sun exposure 
4. mucosa - ulcers, serose 

## Clinical Presnetation 
- 1/3rd of patients have butterfly rash (so not all patients)
- most common presentation is **ARTHRITIS** 
- Oral lesions occur in 40% of SLE Patients 
	- whitish plaque with erythema in the center and keratotic striae in the periphery with telangiectasia 
	- discoid lesions 
	- may look similar to Lichen Planus 
	- mouth ulcers 

## Management 
Goals:
1. Mainain lowest degree of activity using immunomodulators and avoiding known trigggers 
2. prevent organ damage from active lupus 
3. reduce comorbidities secondary to lupus an dits treatment, especially accelerated atherosclerosis 
4. address fatigue and pain 
Lifestyle management 
Need medical clearance 
Consider drugs 
	-aspirin and NSAIDS - bleeding may increase 
	-corticosteroids - 
	- use of anticoagulants in patients that have a high risk for thromboembolic events 
		- coagulation tests (INR and prothrombin) 
Photosensitivity is common in SLE 
- it can exacerbate symptoms such as fatigue, joint pain, and cutaneous lesions 
- should be taken regarding exposure to fluorescent ligth 

### Hydroxychloroquine
- inhibition of B-cell receptor and signaling as well as intracellular activiation 
- reduces lupus flares, and organ damage 

### Vitamin D 

### other immunomodulators 
- Dehydroepiandrosterone DHEA 
- methotrexate 

# SJogren's Syndrome 
- chronic autoimmune disease, characterized by ocular an doral dryness from lacrimal and salivary gland dysfunction 
- 0.5% to 5.0% of general population, but more common in females 

## Triad of clinical conditions 
- xerostomia 
- CT disease 
- keratoconjunitva secca 

## 2 forms. 
Primary SS
- it is not assoc. with other diseases, just dry eyes and dry mouth 
Secondary SS 
- keratoconjunctivitis or xerostomia w/ an autoimmune connective tissue disorder (rhumatoid arthritis, lupus, etc)

## Etiology 
- environment + genetics 
- viral triggers 

## Diagnosis - Presence of various signs and symptoms of the disease 

## ORal findings 
- related to dry mouth 

## Oral findings 
- decreased salivary secretion 
- most common oral findings, dental caries 
- tongue depapillation 
- enlargement of glands seen extraorally 

## Dental management 
- dental management: preventive treatment, fluoride rinse, artifical saliva (sugarless candy, gum, avoid ethanol, alcohol, tobacco)
- soft tissue lesions and soreness (treatment and maintenance) 

Common oral lesions of
