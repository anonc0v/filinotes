B4 - retraction clamp - pushes tissue away
retentive clamp - holds rubber dam in place
Dr Romero's Universal clamps - W3, W2, W8A, 212 : can perform isolation in 99% of cases
W3 = 2nd to largest hole for all molars
W2 = 2nd to smallest hole for all other teeth
Retentive clamp = largest hole
5-6mm between perforations for posterior teeth
W3 or W8A = molars
W2 = premolars
-floss ligature technique for teeth with very deep margins.  as the floss tightens it will push the rubber dam subgingivally

#todo 
- [ ] keep the yellow and white lab papers
- [ ] have the control laboratorio paper

#buy
jota diamond bur kit

prostho case discussion:
- photographies intra/extra oral
- diagnostic wax-up (articulated)
- articulated models
- Plan (fase iii, fase iv, fase v)
- materials used (Zc, lithium disilicate, metal ceramic, gold, cast metal, porcelain fused to zirconia) - properties and indications
- know the LAB
- have pseudo treatment plan budget made

cast metal/gold
finish line: chamfer
-width of finish lne: 1mm
axial tissue removal: 1mm
taper 12-16
occlusal 1-1.5mm

lithium disilicate
-up to 3 unit bridge
-not recommended for molars, but some brands you can use on molars 
zr - you can do more than 3 unit bridge

retention - derived from taper of preparation
stability -derived from height of tooth

taper = total oclussal convergence
longer teeth require highter toc
shorter teeth requires less toc to help with frictional retention
clinical studies say 16-22 degree taper is okay
but the ideal is actually 2-6 degrees for adex they want only up to 10 degrees taper

emax - resin
zirc - resin (better) or GI 
PFM = gic 

temp bond- used here in clinics by Kerr
use the non-eugenol tempbond
can use PTA (other temp cement but more retentive)

#tips/fpd
Can remove the eugenol by brushing with alcohol

acid can activate MMPSs (matrix metalloproteinases)

my dental kit - anterior prep video

types of gingival retraction
- mechanical
- chemical
- mechanical-chemical - most used

vertical displacement exposes the margin - by medication
horizontal displacement - by cord (If no medication only goes horizontal)

Mechanical methods
woody 1993 
donovan 1985
00- yellow
0 - purple
1 - blue
2- green

aluminum chloride
ferrous sulfate
epinephrine
ferric sulfate, al. chloride, tetrahydrozoline ((from visine), oxymetazoline hydrochloride (0.05%) (from afrine - decongestant)

000 for lower anterior
00 for laterals
0 for canines upper and lower and 2 centrals maybe premolars
1 molars
for 2 cord techinque - 000 then 00
#tips soak for 20 minutes before 

Instruments:
- cord packer
- do not use probe - thin it can slip and you'll create a pocket with the amount of pressure needed 
- do not use spoon excavator

For Ultrapak, which is a MESH THREAD, do not use a serrated cord packer, use a straight/flat edge

1950s - polysuslfide
1960s - condensation silicone
1972 - Polyether

pvs - copies up to 200micrometers (um)

Hydrophilic - high copying of details (that's why PVS.. ur tooth has to be dry)

Elastomeric materials have to have handling times of 2 min plus polymerization time from 2-6 minutes
-method to extending the working time of an impression material - put in refrigerator

dimensional stability - PVS can last up to 7 days

putty is considered - extra heavy body

Biotypes
-with thin biotype - be careful with amount of pressure, may cause gingival recession
-thick biotype - 

Two-cord technique
-put 000 cord soaked in water
-you have to be able to see it. if 000 is too small use 00
