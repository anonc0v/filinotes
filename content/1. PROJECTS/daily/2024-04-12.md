# Action Items

# Title
Evaluation
imaging - most common is panoramic; b/c it's what we ask for first 
gold standard - CBCT; esp for impacted canine

Tx for impacted canine:
observation
traction
extrusion
exposure

**Treatment**
Determination of future risk
-odontogenic syst - enucleation, marsupialization
-dentigerous cysts normally dont 
-most teeth assoc.

Just for Dentigerous cyst:
-marsupialization and traction into position for a premolar
-but normally all teeth related to pathology

Symptomatic Teeth
- infection of surrounding tissues - edema, inflammation, keratocyst, 
- Radiographic evidence of changes
	- cyst formation
	- adjacent teeth resorption
	- root resorption of impacted teeth
!SURGERY

Asymptomatic teeth 
- age; 
	- why extract after age 25 the risk of complications increases
- specific rpevalence of pathologic conditions
- severity of potential pathology associated with impacted teeth
	- <3% chance of developing into a cyst 
- progression of untreated conditions
	- affect roots of 2nd molar, arch length deficiency
- frequency and severity of potential complications of treatment 
	- most common: pericoronitis
- potential patient discomfort
- inconvenience associated with either treatment or not treatment
- economic consequences of treatment 
!LEAVE ALONE

Treatment 
- exposure - most common surgical treatment for orthodontic treatment;  maybe traction
- uprising
- transplantation
- removal

Pericoronitis 
- no need to prescribe Antibiotics 
- -prevention

cysts and tumors
- 3%
- <40 yo
- treatment: marsupialization if cyst is very big in order to decrease the size of the lesion
- how it grows:
	- remants of odontogenic cells nourished by surrounding vessels 
	- keeps growing
	-  center of mass no longer nourished and dies 
	- keeps growing; surrounded by a capsule
Prevention
- root resorption of adjacent teeth
- prevention of jaw fracture
- extremes of age

Diversion of path of canal 
darkening of apical portion of root
white line interruption
root dilaceration
canal narrowing

types of nerve injury

Pell & Gregory classification

95% of lower 3rds that are alredy erupted have 2 roots and there's presence of oblique ridge that may prevent good purchase area 

osteotomy - cut bone vs ostectomy - removal of bone

next topic: odontogenic infections

Do not damage:
Lingual nerve is 3-5.8mm away from mandible
1-3mm below

temporabl buccal nerve 
long buccal nerve -closer to cheek and too high so u wont damage it

external oblique line - insertion of buccinator;
b/w external and internal oblique line- superior constrictor muscle

Inferior alveolar nerve 
-Truncular technique ... block?
- gum from premolars
Long buccal nerve - need to anes the gums
-supraperiosteal 
Anes with epinephrine
- lidocaine/articaine 

Can you use epinephrine if px has 145/96?
Yes: - controls hemmorhage, perfusion , potency, lasts longer 

Lidocaine/articaine: 90 min pulp block; 2-3 hrs soft tissue - lidocaine ; 4-6 hrs of soft tissue - articaine 

1.8mL 
need to block 8mm of length of tissue 

magetti; maxillo oral facial surgery book;

Posterior superior alveolar nerve; can use PSA block to extract upper 3rd
-the muscle that can be damaged is buccinator muscle

Complications:
- bleeding
- stiffness
- swelling
- patient bruising
*** 3 days of cold therapy
*** 4 days of warm therapy 
*** 1 hours every 6-8hours
*** no smoking/ no alcohol/no Hot liquids/

Infection : 24-72 hours
fracture*
alveolar osteitis (dry socket) - presents after 24 hours
nerve disturbances 

Rare complications 
- displacement to infratemporal fossa
- displacement to maxillary sinus - amoxicillin/clavulanic acid + loratidine q 8 hours; sterimor 
- displacement to pterygoid space
- mandibular fracture - wrap head with bandage under neck above head and send to hospital 
- displacement to submandibular space 

Dry socket treatment:
- not an infection; its a lack of healing
- clot has desmosomal junctions 
- do not currettage dry socket
- just irrigate with saline  and place a cotton ball with a little bit of eugenol in the base of sockett (you can also use alvogel..but says not as effective)
- then put large cotton ball with nothing 
- ask patient to come next day and replace cottton ball; irrigate with saline befre
- have paient come; large cotton with eugenol on tip; it will remove by itself eventually; after 7 days recall 
1st day: irrigation; small eugenol cotton ball; large cotton ball
2nd day: irrigation; small eugenol and large cotton ball
3rd day: irrigation; large cutton ball and it will fall out by itself 
1 week after: check 

No improvement seen until 72 hours

Shock is defined asÂ a state of cellular and tissue hypoxia due to either reduced oxygen delivery, increased oxygen consumption, inadequate oxygen utilization, or a combination of these processes.

Cellulitis: hard, tender
- acute (3-7 days)
- hot
- diffuse
- content: serosangineous fluid
- indurated 
- color: red
- bacteria: mixed / staphylococcus Aureus
- size: large
abscess: soft, tender
- chronic (>5 days)
- moderately heated
- localized 
- content: pus
- fluctuant 
- shiny center
- bacteria: anaerobic / group A Streptococci 
- size: small
