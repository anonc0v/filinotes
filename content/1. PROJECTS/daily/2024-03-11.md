- HIV
- classified into stagese based on CD4 count
	- Stage 1: acute 
		- very infectiou
	- Stage 2: chronic
		- no symptoms but can transmit HIV
		- if patient has HIV treatment, may not progress into Stage 3
	- Stage 3: AIDS
		- most severe stage
		- CD4+ lymphocyte count < than 200/mm3
		- easily transmit HIV to others
		- damaged immune stystems, w/ increase in opportunistic infection
		- increased number of oral manifestations (OM)
- HIV entry to T Cell/CD4 lymphocyte
	- Pathogenesis/Etiology
- HIV Transmission
	- sharing needles
	- pregenancy
	- blood transfusion
	- organ transfusion
	- unprotected sex
- HIV is not transmitted
	- utensils
	- mosquitoes

- Diagnosis
	- ELISA (enzyme-linked)
	- Confirmatory test
		- Western Blot
	- Procedure
		- 1) refer to lab for ELISA test
		- 2) test must be repeated if it is indeterminate or positive
		- 3) if the repeated test is still indeterminate or positive, Western Blot test
		- HIV antibody test may not occur until 6 mo after exposure
- Normal CD4+ lymphocyte count: 500-1500 cells/uL of blood
	- low counts of CD4+ cells is associated with development of OM
- Initial immune suppresision, (CD4 <500 cells/uL) signals appearance of systemic/oral manifestations

Treatment
	ART

OM
Most common
1) Candidiasis
2) Oral hairy leukoplakia

Candidiasis
	4 types
		- psudomembranous
		- atrophic
		- angular cheilitis
		- hypeerplastic
	- treetment: Nystatin, flucanozole
	
Hairy leukoplakia
- White patch on lateral border of tongue
- Corrugated white plaque on latreal border of tongue
- some have burning sensation
- produced by Epstein-Barr virus

Kaposi's Sarcoma
- most common malignant neoplasm in HIV-positive patients in the AIDS stage
- Appears as a red, bluish, or purplish macular or nodular lesions that do not blanche with compression, most often occuring on the palate or gingiva
- initial stage they ar easymptomatic, in ulcerated leseions the patient manifsets intense pain
- treatment: resection

Oral Warts (condyloma acuminatum)

Varicella Zoster Virus infection
- caused by reactivation of latent varicella zoster virus w/ immune compromise
- unilateral distribution is painful....

Recurrent apthous Ulcerations
- HIV positive patients may exhibit painful, intraoral slow-healing ulcers that may recur
- often do not produce a definitive etiological source such as herpes simplex, cytomegalovirus....

Xerostomia
- Benign lymphoepithelial leesions of the salivary glands may occur and result in glandular enlargement and xerostomia.

Orofacial manifestations related to administration of antiretrovirals
- HIV infection can be controlled if adequately treated w/ HAART
- However, it has been associated with adversee orofacial effeects
	- erythema multiforme
	- lichenoid reactions
		- this is unilateral; lichen planus is bilateral
	- apthous stomatitis

Dental Treatment Modifications
1. consultation w/ patient's physician
2. Attention should be given to detecting the presence of orofacial manifestations
3. preventive procedures
4. with advannced HIV disease, dental treatment plan may nneed to be modified according to the immunological and hematological status and general medical condition
5. all patients should bee considered potentially infectious and treated w/ full infection control
6. asymptomatic HIV-positive patient and in early stages of diseease can safely receive dental care
7. Patient w/ lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia or severe systemic deteriation, it is necessary to make adjustment to the dental care plan due to the risk of bleeding and infection
8. subjects with AIDS the extension of the dental process will largeely depend on their systemic condition and life expectancy

	Hematological tests:
	- total white blood cell count
	- differential white blood cell count
	- hematocrit
	- ....
Drug Actions/Interactions
- Protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase innhibitors interfere w/ drug-metabolizing enzymes
- altering the metabolism of benzodiazepines and macrolide antibiotics

Controversial: Antibiotic prophylaxis for dental treatment for HIV-infected patients
- depends on stage

- [ ] **Management of occupational blood exposure**
after needle exposure, chances of infection:
Hep B - 1:3 (if not vaccine)
Hep C - 1:30 (no vaccinantion)
HIV - 1:300

HIV +/unkown - HIV post exposure prophylaxis; first dose <30 min
	truvada + raltegravir or dolutegravir; 5 days; followup after 48 hours; 

HepB
1) clinically relavant exposure?
2) ask if patient is - do. nothing; if + and not vaccinated then give...
3) draw from patient and exposed worker

HEP C - no PEP (post-exposure prophylaxis)

Vegetative Chronic Genital Herpex
- atypical presentation of HSV2 coifnected w/ hIV

HSV 1 - Trigeminal gngaglia
HSV 2 - Sacral ganglia

- During dormancy in the ganglion, it will make copies of itself, then will go to the epithelium
- usually on ipsilatareal side of infected ganglion
- Prodrome: one or two before blisters appear - tingling/burning sensation

HSV in immunocompromixed individuals
- more frequent reactivation
- more severe symptoms
- wider range of symptoms

Imiquimod
- topical cream
- treatment for actinic keratoses, for superficial basal cell carcinoma

Herpesviruses
- >80 ideentified
- HSv1 - most often acquired during childhood
- enveloped, lipid bilyar

Pathogenesis
- virus reaches peripheral sensory nerve terminals through the axon, reaches the sensory ganglia and infects the ...

Triggers

- trauma
- fever
- menstrual cycle
- immune system suppresesion

Recurrent herpes infection is sometimes associated w/ traumatic dental procedures such as local anesthetic injection

Transmission
- principal mode of acquisition is through direct expsoure of mucous membranes or abraded skin to the leesions or mucosal secretions of an individual with ...

HSV-1 causes oral infections, from mild like cold sores to severe like meningoencephalitis

Herpes labial
- outer 1/3rd of lip most frequently affected
- patient notices prodrome of tingling, itching, burning
- followed by papule that progresses to vesicular
- vesicles develop w/in hours and progress to ulceration and crusting w/in 72 to 96 hours
- after its rupture, scabs appear that heal w/o leaving a scar b/w 8 and 15 days

The vesicles are th emost dangerous b/c it is very contagious

Intraorally, they occur almost on the keratinized mucosa of the hard palate and the attached gingiva, and occasionally on the dorsum of the tongue
- important to know for differential diagnosis of:
	- herpetic apthous form
	- aphthous stomatitis

apthous stomatitis - more common in nonkeratinized tissue
vs herpes vs RAS

# Hepatitis
5 different types

Liver
- synthesizes the most essential serum proteins 
	- albumin, transporter proteins, blood coagulation factors V VII IX X, prothrombin, fibrinogen, hormones and growth factors
	- metabolizes compounds: bilirubin, drugs
	- regulation of nutrients
	- conversion of sugar to glycogen
	- produces bile and its transporters

Hepatitis
- inflammation of the liver
- can become chronic, and lead to end-stage liver disease and or hepatocellular changews....

Viral Hepatitis
- can be caused by hepatitis A thru E

Most common: HAV HBV, HCV
- 80k/year
- 4.4 million Americans living with chronic hepatitis
- 25% of liver chirosis

HAV
- small, noneveloped RNA virus of the genus HEpatovirus
- go into liver cells and replicate
- HAV very rare, but there's HAV vaccine availbe in 1995 incidence has decreased by 95%
transmission: fecal-oral transmission. spread of virus is increased by poor oral hygiene

Symptoms of hepatitis A
...

- Self-limiting
- adequate nutrition
- avoid hepatoxins
- medicine
- 30% still require hospitalization

Hepatitis B
- double stranded, enveloped, DNA virus of hepadnaviridae family.  Major cause of chronic ... worldwide

95% of acute are self-limiting
5% progress to chronic infection

Incubation period for HBV - 45 to 180 days
HBsAg can be detected in blood as early as 30 to 60 days after exposure

symptoms
