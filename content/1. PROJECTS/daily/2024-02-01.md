biomechanical considerations for the restoration of endodontically treated teeth; Didier Dietschi - part 1 and 2

-placement of post depends on # of walls lost. If it's just one wall you can put onlay or crown.

cavity class/ suggested restoration / cusap coverage?
class I

Ferrule effect?
Need more ferrule effect for anteriors
**2mm min ferrule**; consider the average ferrule

**4mm min. crown height anteriors**

In multi-rooted teeth, how do you choose which root to place a post?
straightest, thickest, longest
lower molar - distal root
upper molar- palatal

How much GP should be left when preparing a post?
**leave 3.5mm GP minimum** when preparing post

Cast post:
-then take xray and measure post space
-use duralay to take impression of post space
-smooth out the duralay impression with straight handpiece bur
-put vaseline in cavity (coronal part)
-then take whole impresssion including pulpal space and upper (which will become the buildup)
-carve full anatomy of the buildup
-send to lab and remove the plaster with sandblast
-take PRE CEMENTATION xray
-cementation
- dry with paper points
- GI for cast post
- Resin - for fiber posts
- do not use lentulo spiral to put the cement
- just put extra cement around the post

cementation for fiber posts
-in post radiograph - check that post is touching GP, head is out
-surface treatment - silane on post

Etching acid and bonding (Only in coronal part where you'll put composite)
-

parapost brand 0.9mm / file #35-#40
rebuildup brand file #60, so parapost is better b/c it's thinner and the post space prep is more conservative

better to work with ana paula b/c dr rodrigo and dr sandra will make you do impression of post space etc

zinc phosphate - 5-8 years
1968 - polycarboxylate - used as a provisional cement nowadays
1972- conventional ionomer
1981 - cementing compoiste
1992 - resin-modified ionomer (GI modified with resin)
2002 - self-adhesive resin cement

There is no cementing material for universal use

Adhesive cements resin-based

particle size: microparticles + bisGMA
microhybrid - less viscous
for posts u want it to be thicker

Adhesive systems
Sef-adhesives - RelyX Unicem, 3M ESPE best
can be used for lots - PFMs, posts, zirconia
(not veneers - they have another line of cements for veneers)

Do not cement Zirc crowns with Glass IONOMer - there are better choice

veneers, onlays, inlays - light cured cements
-high chromatic stability

cementation prortocol
-clean cement with prophy paste and prophy brush 

for metal:
GIC
1 spoon: 2 drops liquid
lasts 8-10 years

GIC Cements:
Types:
conventional inomeric cements (fillings)
resin-reinforced ionomeric cements - 
Red one for cements - Type I GIC


Resin-Based cement
-sandblasted by lab

Cementing protocol - GIC
- isolate - no rubber dam tho

Cementing protocol - with resin-based - eat after 2 hrs (mexican time; but 1 hr is enough)

dual adhesive - except for veneers (u want light cured)

cementing proctocol for LD or feldspathic indirect (veneers, etc)
-
-adhesive - 
Try-in paste - to simulate shade of cement so you can choose the correct shade

silane -2 types: ultradent, monobond 

ceramic cementation:
silane* works only on feldspathic and lithium disilicate/ emax NOT on zirconia

ivoclar 9% - does not have MDP
monobond plus has MDP

definitive lc is 40seconds

zirconia - 
cleaner - zirconia cleaner (but there's no cleaner in mexico)
-best cement is something with MDP (monobond plus has this; if assistant doesn't have, there's also MDP in universal adhesive)
-place primer
-if cement doesn't have MDP, then apply a ZR primer that has MDP 
-panavia V5 cement - also has MDP
-it's not required to put primer first 
-other adhesives with MDP (in pic)

2 ways to treat
Smear layer – etching then disinfect with CHX
Smear layer – bonding that is made to bond

oxygen inihibited layer lets the next layer of composite to bond together

Immediate dentin sealing protocol

Load adhesive - has more percentage of filling - has pic - optibond FL (60-70% microfilled)(Kerr), Clearfil SE Bond Primer, universal bonding
gliserine - avoid oxygen inhibited layer (afterwards you cant add more resin)

chlorhexidine - look at pic

to reactivate the oxygen inhibited layer - sandblast your prep
