# Alveolar bone

CONTAINS THE FOLLOWING:
## 1) alveolar bone proper
- inner wall of compact bone
- contains many foramina through which neruovascular bundles reach the PL
- radiographically is called **lamina dura**
- embedded with this are the extrinsic collagen fiber bundles
- contains the following 2:
## 2) cancellous bone:
- also called spongy bone
- betwene the two compact layer
- composes the interdental septum
- yellow marrow with a lot ofadipose cells fills the intertrabecular spaces
- absorbs shock more than cortical bone

## 3) cortical bone
- an external plate formed by haversian and compacted bone lamellae
- meets the alveolar bone at the alveolar crest at 1.5 - 2mm below CEJ
- thinner in the maxilla and thickest on buccal of mandibular molars and premolars


type of graft: cancellous/cortical bone: 30% cortical/70% cancellous (most) 
- depends on what kind of bone
- cortical bone - will take blood vessels forever to penetrate. etc
- [ ] type of bone to use - investigate - research

even the most perfect extraction, there'll be resorption of the buccal bonek

Cells and intercellular matrix
- osteoblasts (OBL) produce the organic matrix
- they come from plurirotent cells
- bone growth occurs by apposition of an organic matrix depostied by OBL
- consists of 2/3rds of inorganic matter and 1/3rd of organic matrix

Inorganic Matter
- constitutes 60-70% of bone weight
- composed principally by minerals caclium and phosphate
- also contains carbonate, sodium magnesium and fluorine
- contains 99% of body's calcium, 85% of phosphorus and 40-60% of sodium 

Organic MAtter
- consists mainly of collagen type I 99%
- constitutes 35% of bone weight
- Small amounts of non collagen proteins such as oste4ocalcin, osteonectin and proteoglycans
	- function not fully kjnown
	- theory: helps collagen fibers be stronger
	- found around "cables" of collagen
- they regulate bone mineralization

Remodeling
- bone changes in shape, resistance to forces, repair of wounds and calcium homoestasis in the body
- bone contains 99% of calcium of the body
- the major source for calcium release when it decreases in blood levels
- changes according to habits like bruxism, or systemic disease
- the bone matrix laid by OBL is nonmineralized and called osteoid
- while new osteoid is deposited the older one below becomes mienralized
- bone resorption is related to the appearance of a ruffled border (Howship's lacunae)
- Resorption0 generated by hydrolytic enzymes prdouced bye osteoclasts (CLS)
- [ ]  review bone anatomy; osteoid, haversian systems; ___ found not in all parts of the bone; just in certain parts
- [ ] Seibert's classification for bone losss
- enzymes digest the organic portion of bone
- its function can be regulated by hormones such as parathromone (PTH)
- **Ten cate** descxribes resorptive process as follows:
1) attachmetn of the OCL to the nienralized surface of bone
2) Creation of a sealed acidic environment which deminieralizes bone

Seibert's classification
Class I: there's width but no height
Class 2: there's height but no width
Class 3: no width no height
	- bone graft first
	- then soft tissue surgery

horizontal/width - easier to restore than height; 


Vertical defects
one wall defect - WORST scenario; only 1 wall remaining, the 3 are gone; require more than 1 surgery also required membrane
2 wall defect - there's 2 walls remaining
3 wall defect - there's 3 walls remaining

Crater defects - can be grafted up until the highest point of the defect (may have different heights on mesial/distal sides); not all are worth grafting

Furcation involvement
Classification
Hawp's (I to III)
Glickman's (I to IV)
- III soft tissue covering furca but goes through and through
- IV soft tissue doesn't cover furca and goes through and thgrough
- there are subclassifications
- ABC
	- vertical bone height
	- A: upper third
	- B: middle third
	- C: apical third

periodontal osseous defects are generally classified by:
**b) the number of bony walls left surroudning the tooth**
a) the number of bone walls that were destroyed by PD
c) the number of bony walls that will remain after surgery
D) periodontal probe readings

When evaluating an osseous defect, the only way to determine the nujber of walls left surroudnign the tooth is buy:
a) periodontal probing
**b) periodontal surgery**
c) radiographs
d) testing mobility

In a suprabony pocket, the epithelial attachment is located:
a) coronal to the alveolar crest
b) apical to alveolar bone crest
c) non e of the above

- suprabony is horizontal in nature

Infrabony pockets
- angular in nature
- the bone loss is horizontal in nature
- transseptal fibers are horizontal

Easier to graft in Vertical defects
