physical examination

physical exam
- gender >. male/masculino ; female/femenino
- age > edad/ yo - aÃ±os
- consciousness - cognitive problems
- head
	- shape
	- hair
	- eyes
	- ears
	- nose
	- tmj
	- mouth > DO, oclussion, cheeks, alveolar ridges, palate, tongue, floor of the mouth, oropharynx

Caries is not a diagnosis that is indicated for extraction of 3rd molar
Age is a factor - 56 years old; no need
Ages 15 - 26 years old

when describing: e.g. pathology
Superior, inferior, lateral medial, posterior, anterior
- lateral = superficial

Physical Examination
- Labios - i see an exophytic lesion on the lower left lip.  give preliminary diagnosis; vestibule = vestibulo; mucosa yugal = carillos
- paladar duro
- paladar blando
- pilar anterior faringeo
- piso de boca
- vientre de la lengua
- dorso de la lengua

granulos de fordyce

exosotosis/exophytic lesion on the left - do not state name of lesion until you have a histopathologic study

bigger than normal = hypertrophic; cavernous?

# Surgery Day

## Aseptic Technique
- Mayor vs Minor surgery?
- no boots
- all clinic is gray area

- antiseptic solution for oral cavity; chx gluconate 0.12%
	- povidone iodine solution
- antiseptic solution for perioral disinfection
	- surgical soap
	- iodopovidone solution

perioral region then oral cavity
perioral 
- technique 1: start in middle philtrhum then a swirl
- Technique 2: start in center then straight streaks outward 

Drapes around face and chest of patient;
- protect patient
- if instrument drops, you can just pick it up again

Hand washing
chlorhex digluconate 4%
povidonie iodinng 7.5%
ammonium bromide 1%

Surgical attire
- surgical gown
- sterile gloves

Impacted Teeth
incidence:
grove & lorton 3rd molars > maxillary canine
myrberg 6,000 childrens > 5.4% prevalence
Dachi & Howell 3874 > 0.92% canine impactationn
grandahl 1,418 women > 25 non-third molar impacted teeth
	Mx Canine > Md bicuspids > Mx bicuspids > 2nd molar

Lower left 3rd molar - MOST COMMON
- study where the lower left ramus is 6mm shorter than the right

Primary teeth impactation is quite rare. Mandibular molar
Bianchi & Roccuzzo 10 cases in literature in 20 years

# Impacted Teeth
Etiology
" a tooth than can not, or will not, erupt into its normal functioning position, and is, therefore, pathologic and requires treatment"
treatment - extraction, traction, exposure, observation

systemic factors
- syndromes (cleidocranial dysplasia, down syndrome) > primary retention
- endocrine deficiences (Hypothyroidism, hypopituitarism)
- febrile diseases
- irradiation (leukima - lymphoblastic)
	- petersonns principles of oral & maxillofacial surgery

Local factors
- prolonged diciduous tooth retention
- malposed tooth germs
- arch-length deficiency
- supernumerary teeth
- odontogenic tumors (abnormal eruption path)
- cleft lip and palate (canine most common on the side of the cleft - required bone grafting)

Jacoby labially unerupted mx canine > arch length deficiency.
Palatal position related with extra space available

Bichara "...Presence of the lateral incisor root w/ normal length at the normal time is important to guide th ecanine in a proper eruptive direction"

problems caused by impacted teeth
- malocclusion
- loss of arch length
- migration or loss of neighboring teeth
- periodontal disease
- root resorption of adjacent teeth
- resorption (internal or external) of the impacted tooth
- dentigerous cysts
- odontogenic tumors
- **pericoronitis** - most common

Evaluation
- Clinical inspection
- to identify, diagnose, and treat for canines: Gold standard - CBCT
	- for 3rd molars - not always necessary to use CBCT unless associated with IAN canal

- Third mola rmost common tooth
- - 9 yo Crown Rx finding > 2 years later cusp mineralization
- 14-20 yo > root formation & final position
	- 2/3rd root of canine is formed, then you can extract the 3rd molars

Treatment
- determination of future risk
- <3% chance of developing a cyst/tumor after the age of 40 years old;

complicaitons:
after age of 25: 
dry socket
infection
fracture of mandible
after age 50: fracture

Treatment - Surgical extraction
- symptomatic teeth
- infetction of surrounding tissues
- radiographic evidence of changes
	- cyst formation
	- adjacente teeth resorption
	- root reesorption of impacted teeth

Asymptomatic teeth - factors to consider before treatment
- age
- specfiic prevalence of pathologic conditions
- severity of potential pathology associated w/ impacted teeth
- progression of untreateted conditions
- frequency and severity of potential complications of treatment
- potential patient discomfort
- inconvencience associated with either treatmen tor not treamtnet
- economic consequences of treatment*

Treatment
- exposure - pedo patient; teeth just needs exposure then tooth will erupt by himself
- uprising 
- transplantation
- removal

odontopexy?

Periocoronitis 
- peptoestreptococcus, fusobacterium & bacteroides (porphyromonas).
- operculectomy does not work b/c it will just grow back
- bone cannot be eexposed

PRevention
Cysts annd Tumors
<3% chance of developing cyst after 40 years old

- make window, do marsupialization, suture cyst to gingiva, leaving a hole, wait 3- 6 months for cyst to get smalleer, then you are able to do enucleation (w/ extraction of molar) with less trauma b/c it has shrunk

PReventionn
- root resorption of adjacent teeth
- prevention of jaw fracture
- extremes of age - 88 - bleeding, infection fracture

Signs of intimacy of Nerve to 3rd molar -
	Diversion of the path of the canal
	Darkening of apical portion of root
	white line interruption
	root dilaceration
	canal narrowing


Vit B (complex) e/24hrs x 30 days
Dexamethasone - 1 shot - works for 3 days; 45 hrs
Nucleo CMP Forte - every 8 hours x 15 days

Types of nerve injury                                                                                                                        
a. NEUROPRAXIA - the mildest form of injury and described as slight localized myelin sheath damage without continuity defect                                   
- what you would most probably experience if you undergo odontectomy                                                        
- nerve is still anatomically intact but because of trauma and compression of the nerve, it causes a sensory derangement or temporary paresthesia             |
 b.  AXONOTMESIS - disruption and damage to axons and myelin sheath without disruption of the perineurium or epineurium: still has a chance of healing but less 
 c. NEUROTMESIS - severe disruption of the nerve trunk which may possibly result to permanent neurosensory defect; chance to become permanent nerve derangement
