# Action Items

# Patterns of Bone Resorption 

# objecttive of periodontal treatmnet
- eliminate the inflammation to suppress resorption stimulus to allow the regeneration and bone apposition 

- Local and systemic factors >>> bone resorption and apposition >>> bone height and density 

The amount of bone loss is not always related to:
- level of gingival inflammation 
- dental plaque
- presence or absence of pus
- ulcerations on the pocket wall

Gingivitis always happens before periodontitis but not all gingivitis develop PD
Chronic inflammation {plaque composition, host response, cellular composition of the CT} = PD

## histopathology
- inflammation extends through collagen fibers following blood vessels 
- from gingiva to bone, inflammation destroys:
	- gingival fibers 
	- periodontal fibers 
- in bone, inflammation extends through marrow spaces  

- internal resorption >>> thinning of the bone >>> expansion to marrow spaces >>> bone resorption and loss of bone height 

- Transseptal fibers regeneration and are ALWAYS present no matter how severe the PD 
- bone loss is not because of necrosis, it's due to remodeling 
- in cases of necrosis, suppuration comes from the internal wall of the pocket 

- plaque ratio (radius) of action: 1.5-2.5mm 
- bone destruction is intermittent 
- has periods of inactivity 

## MEchanisms of bone destruction 
- bone destruction is mediated by bacteria and host response 
- bacterial products induce  differentiation of cells into osteoclasts 
- *in PD bacteria is found between collagen fibers and over bone surface = direct effect*  - main way 

- Exacerbation and remission match with 
	- degree of inflammation 
	- amount of bleeding 
	- plaque composition 
		- no point in knowing the exact composition b/c we have products like chlorhexidine or broad-spectrum antibiotics that can act as an adjunct to mechanical methods of plaque elimination
	- amount of exudate 

## Bone destruction by trauma of occlusion 
- it can cause bone loss with or without inflammation 
- Without inflammation: 
	- compression and widening of the PL
	- increase of osteoclasts activity 
	- periodontal ligament space >>> widening 
	- bone and/or root resorption 
- With inflammation:
	- increases bone loss 
	- generates bone defects in different patterns - crater defects (generation seen in lone teeth due to forces the tooth experiences all around) 
# Factors that determine bone morphology in PD

## Anatomical characteristics that modifies bone patterns 
- thickness, width and angulation of bone crests 
- thickness of vestibular and lingual of bone corticals 
- presence of fenestrations and/or dehiscence 
- teeth alignment
