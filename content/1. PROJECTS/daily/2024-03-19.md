#pedo/class 

3 months you can see white spot

first tooth brush invented in 1780

How long do restorations last?
Sealant - 3 years
Composite - 5 years
Amalgam - 15 years
Endo - 10-15 years
Onlay - 10-15 years
Crown - 10-15 years

Diagnodent 65-90% accurate
0 to. 10 no caries
11 to 20 - enamel cariees external surface
21 to 30 - enamel caries internal surface
31 or more dentin caries

**exam questions:**
what pH does enamel demineralize = 5.5
if its enamel with fluoride (hydroxyfluooapatite) = 4.5
enamel caries histology: (silverstonee, johnson, hardi)
Layers of demineraliztion = zone superficial, cuerpo de la lesion, zona obscura, zona translucida, exmalte normal
Balance of caries: interaccion de los factorees
- diet  + time + microorganisms + host (biological factors + social fcators)= to form caries
under which material has less recurrent careies:
1) amalgam - 2nd place
2) GIC - 1st place
3) Composite - 3rd place
4) Gold
5) Porcelain
6) Zirconia

Fissurotomy burs is 1.2mm; so one side is 0.6 and the other side is 0.6mm

under which material has less recurrent careies:
1) amalgam - 2nd place (pedo)
2) GIC - 1st place (pedo)
3) Composite - 3rd place (pedo)
4) Gold - 1st place (adults)
5) Porcelain - 
6) Zirconia - 

3m Ketac - good for sealants; see less reecurrent caries

Tratamiento
- el tratamiento de la caries depeende de su etapa de desarrollo, ademas del control de sus factores de riesgo

common ppm of fluoride in store:
1,100
1,450
1,500 - 2x per day; caries down 40% (does not take into account environment - diet); 3x per day 54% decrease
5,000

In office: 20,000ppm - for high caries risk patients 4x per year

Fluor
- 1 aplication of fluoride per year doesn't have a significant effect
- 2 small positive effect
- 3 or 4 have good correlation in decrease caries index
- doesn't matter if you divide and apply it throughout the year or week after week

M.I. Paste
- comes from the casein of the milk
- Casein phosphopeptide-amorphous Calcium Phosphate
- incraeses the amount of phosphate and calcium in the salive
- the saturation of ions enhance the natural process of remineralization
