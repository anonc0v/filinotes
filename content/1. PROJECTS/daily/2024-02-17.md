prostaglandins = fever; 
perfect analgesic:
antypyretic - aceaminophen, analgesic - ketorolac , antiinflammatory - ibuprofen

pain physiology: the ascending pathway magnus
ascending pathway - ain signal goes to brain, where perception of different sensations including pain, in the somatosensory cortex posterior to the central sulcus;  the somatosensory cortex has specific areas that correlate to specific parts of the body

spinal cord - has nerves go out from anterior and go in through posterior root

when a cell is injured, prostaglandings released picked up by nerves and go to dorsal horn of spinal cord; the nerve that transmits it to the spinal cord is a 2nd order neuron (substance P transmits this signal from the 1st order to 2nd order); the 2nd order neuron will cross to the other side of the spinal cord and go to the sphenothalamic tract and go to the brain to the thalamus (the relay station), where the 2nd order neuron synapses with the 3rd order neuron carries it to the specific part of the brain that perceives the pain; 
So the pain regions in the brain are on the opposite side of the part of the body.

the descending pathway - inhibits the ascending pathway; the periaqueductal area of midbrain, nuclues raphe ;  5HT neuron goes down to the spinal cord and control 1st and 2nd order neurons of the 2nd pathway

pulpitis - is a chronic inflammation; the video above is about acute injury/inflammation
the chronic inflmmation will become an acute inflammation when the body loses the

when pain becomes chronic it goes to the limbic side in the frontal cortex; it can be related to depression

most famous in mexico - Dolac; sometimes px change name to: asupradol, toroloco
-lots of problems in stomach; take it after you eat;

Naproxen
ace inhibitors, bisphosphonates, antibiotics - ciprofloxacin, vancomycin; corticosteroids (dexamethasons/prednisone)

Codeine

tramadol
excudexa - acute to severe pain; no side effects

antibiotics

increasing bacteria strength
stress (lower immune system)
multiplication increases
combination of bacteria

when cortisol levels go down

antiobiotics
low doses
do not finish antibiotic
wrong purpose (using it for virus)

fever, trismus, 

quinilones - for respiratory/stomach
