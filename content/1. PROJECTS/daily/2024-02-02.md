#endo

- Upper 1st Molars have 4 canals most of the time
- CBCT you can know how many canals you have even before you do access

- For upper central incisors, you do not want to use file size more than #60 because the canal near the apical 3rd is very small, so you'll be over-preparing the apical 3rd
- Bioceramic sealers (based on MTA - mineral trioxide aggregate) - does not show increased success rates in normal cases; but in specific cases (open apex, perforations) 
- Single cone technique vs multiple cone technique
- Biofilm - dynamic community of bacterial cells embedded in extracellular matrix, attached to a solid surface
	- ex: plaque
	- how to get rid of Biofilm?
		- mechanical means - brushing - oral hygiene, scaling - perio
		- endo: file + irrigate
# Access Preparation
- MUST remove entire roof
- performing RCT through a ninja hole will make your life harder

# access prep outline 
- should just be until the extent of the pulp chamber walls
- **upper molars** start right in the middle not in the mesial part as it says in the books; do not touch marginal ridge
- **lower central incisors** 40% there's 2 canals (labial and lingual)
	- oval shape
	- in the books, touching the incisal edge is a sin
	- but 70% of the time when there are 2 canals, you need to touch the incisal edge
- **Premolars**
	- oval shape (buccal to lingual)
	- just before cusp tips
	- careful in lower premolars b/c the occlusal table is constricted
- **Upper Molars** - trapezoid
	- cusp tip to roof of pulp chamber is avg 6mm 98%
	- study by deutsch 2004
- **Lower Molars** - square in order to find the 4th canal

- sometimes good idea to remove tooth out of occlusion if patient has SAP or remaining tooth structure is very weak and crown will not yet be made
- CDC = cementum dentin in canal - location of the apical constriction, where RCT preparation and obturation should end
	- since it's a constriction, the materials will be contained within the canal
	- Cementoblasts - create cementum,
	- odontoblasts - create pulp
	- past constriction is the PDL; PDL has lots of blood circulation compared to the pulp; there'll be less bacteria because the environment of the PDL has more ability to fight bacteria; therefore there is no reason to go past the constriction; 
	- not all preparation/obturation will end 0.5-1mm due to changes in the position of the apical constriction
		- apex locator will help with this
		- use locator go past foramen then it'll give solid beep then pull back until the beep indicates you're still in canal - this is more accurate
- take working length w/ at least #20 file; if #10 file you won't be able to see the file

# Crown down
- created for necrotic cases
- push less bacteria apically because you have already removed the coronal third
	- therefore, flareup chances is lower b/c you won't innoculate the apical third with bacteria from the coronal third
- Bigger to smaller files as you go more apical
- you can use Gates glidden for this until size #3 

# Step Back 
- from Apical to coronal
- Smaller to bigger files going shorter
- but this is no longer advocated b/c you may push bacteria past the apical foramen

Schilder 1974 - hybrid technique

Explore with #10 file, then use #15 file so that it is passive/completely loose

Then use GG drill #1 as deep as you can go (usually until Middle 3rd)
Then use GG drill #2 until deep as you can (probably shorter)
Then use GG drill #3 until as deep as you can (probably shorter) 

- recommends K-flexofile 
	- the k-flexofile are modified so the sides of the tips are rounded - easier to control 
- After 2-3 accessory cones, take xray

Glick instrument - for cutting the gutta percha
- heat until cherry red, go against orifice 
## Law of Symmetry
- there is an orifice at a distance equidistance from a line dividing a tooth from mesial to distal

# straight line access
- align cusp tip
- orifice of the root canal
- apical constriction

-Cotton pellet
- do not use cotton pellet anymore
- fibers can get contaminated
- other dentists may not completely remove it before the final restoration
- we use **teflon tape** 

- Starts with **round diamond bur** and outlines the extend of the form
- then use **#2 or #3 carbide bur** and do pecking motion until you find the pulp chamber
- then use outward strokes with **round bur** to deroof
- endo-Z bur has noncutting tip; it is a carbide bur but you have to be very precise; otherwise the walls will be jagged; Dr. prefers tape diamond bur with round tip - careful with perforating floor
- check for any remaining roof with the hooked end of a regular #5 Explorer
- pulp horns contain pulp remants and can stain the tooth
- endo explorer DG16
# Irrigant

### Sodium Hypochlorite 
- Full Concentration: 5.25%
- only irrigant to dissolve  organic tissue
### CHX 2%
Reaction: CHX + NaOCL = Orange-brown precipitate (parachloroaniline)
- occludes dentinal tubules
- carcinogenic
- sticky (difficult to remove)
Reaction: CHX + EDTA = White foggy precipitate 
- degrades CHX
- CHX becomes useless
Reaction: NaOCL + EDTA
- renders NaOCL ineffective
- gas formation of chlorine gas in low amounts

do not use RC Prep (contains EDTA)
- Both EDTA and RC Prep, consequently, causes erosion or opening of the dentinal tubules (through removal of smear layer?)

there will be calcification attempts by the body to cover the extruded GP
