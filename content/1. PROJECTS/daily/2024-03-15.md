	uncontrollable bleeding
	altered alertness
	uncontrolled critical illness

4) Steps of an emergency

	- emergency treatment
	- transalte

# Unconsciousness
predisposing factors
- stress
- impaired physical status - patient ditnt' eat, is sick, has hormonal disease
- administrartion or ingestion of drugs

Clinical manifestations
- does not respond to sensory stimulation (e.g. shake and shout, peripheral pain)
- has lost protective reflexes (swallor og coughing)
- unable to maintain airway patten

Management
- rcognize unconsciousness (lack of response to sensory stimulation)
	- 1) distinguish between conscious or unconscious
		- lack of response to sensory stimulation
		- loss of protective reflexes
		- inability to maintain patent airway
- recognition of unconsciousness
	- 2) termination of dental procedure
		- terminate the dental procedure
		- SSS
		- Position
- MAnagement of the unconsciousness
	- P--position victim
		- place the patient into th esupine (horizontal) position with the brain at the same level as the heart and the feet elevated slightly (a 10-to 15 degree angle)
		- avoid headdown (trendelenburg) position b/c gravity forces the abdominal viscera superiorly up tinto the diaphgragm, thereeby restricting respiratory movement and diminishing the efectiveneses of breating
		- extra head uspports, such as pillow, should be removed from teh headrest of the dental chair
		- if third-trimestere pregnant patient losese consciousness while seated; should face sideways to the left to avoid compression of vessels that can kill mother and baby
	- C - assess circulation
		- carotid artery 
	- A - ASsess and open airway
		- head tilt - chin lift technique
			- one hand placed on forehead, 2 fingers under the victim's chin, lifting the chin and rotating the head upwarda nd backward and 30 degrees to the side 
			- FOR NON-TRAUMA patients
		- jaw-thrust technique (f necessary) - FOR TRAUMA Patients
	- B - rescue breathing (if necessary)
		- if respiratory arrest occurs or if spontatneous veentilation is inadequte, the victimn nmust be ventilatted so that adequate o2 is avilable to the brain.  the victitm may receive breathing in one of the three ways
			- 1) exhaled air ventilation
			- 2) atmospheric (ambient) air ventilation
			- 3) O2 - enriched ventilation
		- C - assiess circulation
- lips blue <75% spO2
	- D - definitive management

Respiratory distress
definitions
A. mild distress - px is able to speak full sentences; patient ay have elevated pulse and bp; patient may be diaphoretic and weak; mental status is unaffected; no cyanonsis is present
B. moderate distress: px able to speak few words; may have elevated pulse and bp; px may be diaphoretic and weak; mental status is unaffected; mild cyanosis of lips and digits may be present
c. severe distress; px unable to spaek; px may have decreased/elevated pulse and /or decreased/elevated bp; mental status is altered; more centtral and profound cyanosis is present

Caveats:
a. patients may have several disease processes together producing shortness of breath; wheezing may occur in diseases other than asthma, and peripheral edema may occur in settings other than congestive heart failure (CHF). Assessment should usually yield a signle treatment plan. in genreal, commit yourseelf to a signgle asssesment - you may modify this assessment baseed on response to therapy and as additional information becomes available.

WHEEZI?NG / - assoc with asthma and anaphylactic shock #exam 

b. patients may have diseases producing hsortness of breath that cannot be relieved w/ any prehospital treatments.  in additoin, some patients will present to the prehospital personnel so far in respiratory fiaulre that mainteneance / establishemnt of an airway together with expeditious transport are the only treatments possible
C. Pulmnoary Edema in the setting of CHF will usually have collaborating signs such as: 
	1) a histtory of CHF and medications such as diuretics and /or angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors
	2) peripheral edema
	3) jugular venous distension (JVD)
