# Action Items

# Rotary instrumentation: Endodontics

- flareup due to extruded debris in vital case
- in necrotic cases, extruded debris may cause failure (just a possibility)

most rotary files are triangular b/c it's it makes them more flexible, compared to square, which has more mass

active vs semiactive tip
semiactive tip = tip is not cutting, just the sides
active - tip is sharp and pointed

Problems
- why do rotary files break?

Concepts
fatigue - there is only a limited number of times rotary files can bend until it breaks; there is only a limit number of times rotary files can twist (torsion)
cyclic fatigue - file freely rotating breaks; breakage thru fatigue Dr. Ruben doesn't consider it a mistake
torsional fatigue - file binds in the canal then breaks; Dr. Ruben considers it an operator error that is preventable; if you feel there's resistance towards apical, don't force it anymore; remove it

fatigue - most likely the file breaks at the curvature

highspeed handpiece >100,000
low speed ~ 14,000
rotary - 350/400/500rpm
- torque: important b/c  without torque every time we have interference, it will stop; so with torque, it will keep rotating even with an interference  (think of tabletop )
- autoreverse feature - if the motor feels that you are applying too much force, it will reverse the rotatiion 

GG #1 = 70
GG #2 = 80
GG #3 = 90

Depending where the curve in the canal is located, will determine where the instrument will have the most stress
- shorter the radius, higher the stress 

Goals of rotary instrumentation 
eliminate 
neutralize 
removal tissue debris 
shape canal

g-pack rotary 
- same size (all size 25)
- but taper changes

if 25 0.04 taper doesn't reach working length
option 1: just start over again and the file will eventually go down
option 2: use GG drill
option 3: use hand file
but Dr. Ruben prefers option 1

Scouting file 
- start with #10, if it doesnt go to TWL, use #8; #15 also considered scouting file 
- Gives infeormation
	- diameter
	- curvature - location, degree of curvature
	- calcification
	- straight line access

Scouting -
- insert watch winding movement
- not to try to go WL
- until to feel resistance
- until file #20
