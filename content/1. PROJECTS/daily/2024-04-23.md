# Title

continuation: in order to avoid perforation, when you're cutting the soft tissue to remove pulp during pulpotomy towards the orifice, you remove pressure from the handpiece (using high speed).  

For apexification: CaOH or MTA, or MTA + Biodentin; MTA is better b/c if you do it with CaOH, the canal will be very calcified and hard to enter later
