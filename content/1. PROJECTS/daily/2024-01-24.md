2% CHX for disinfecting

- dycal no longer used (caOH) b/c there was a study that said it would cause calcification of the pulp
Theracal is used instead:
calcium + triphosphate = theracal
- when adding an old resin to new resin, you use silane first (wetting agent?) to ensure the old and new resins are able to bind chemically

perio
-anything >3mm in RED
perio reevaluation - 3 weeks after last SRP
-after every SRP, you recall after 3 weeks (for healing)

-triangle no base: furcal class -triangle with base: class ii
-triangle colored in - class iii

SAS = BOP (sangrida a sonda)?
-blue dot = suppuration
missing tooth = tooth filled with black ink
impacted teeth = circled black
restorations = blue if sound; red if theres recurrent caries or overhangs
-open contact/diastema = couble line b/w the missing contact areas
malposition = marked with arrow to correspsonding direction
aberrant frenum = blue
periapical pathology = black circle over apex
bone level = in periapical series, black line on pereiodontal xray analysis

malposition
crowding
a = apinamiento 
e extrusion
i inclination

in xray you use red circle only to mark furcal instead of triangle cuz you cant see the class (i, ii, iii) in the xray

-traumatic occ does not itself cause bone loss but combined with inflammation may lead to bone loss

CAL = PD + GR

primary traumatic occ = abfractions and recession
secondary = 

prescriptions = px keeps original (white); copy (yellow) goes in file
-px didn't attend; write on file
1) paracetamol (tempro) 500mg
instructions...

on perio file; exp = file number
mark pre or post treatment; (pre = first treatment)

perio chart:
implant = x
mobility = i, ii, iii
attached gingiva  = it is calculated, not directly measured; encia - highest PPD (if it's lower than 2; just write 0 b/c to maintain health you need a min of 2mm of keratinized tissue AFTER surgery)
furca = i , ii, iii (remember to also draw on tooth)
sas = bop; just mark wherever it is
sondeo = PPD
margin gingival = gum recession = RED LINE
encia = mucogingival line as measured from the gingival margin = blue line

on perio FMX radiographical analysis
4
3
2

complex px = px with perio disease or px that requires 3 or more specialties 
go to perio or prostho teacher to see if px is a complex or simple px 

have professor check your charting the same day,
appoint patient one hour in advance if FMX are necessary b4 perio appointment/charting 

Do perio charting in pencil first so you can do corrections; do not appoint patient if you need to discuss chart with patient

need facebow impressions, with casts mounted, fmx,

ask prostho to check facebow... but if no choice anybody

make a list of commonly prescribed meds
