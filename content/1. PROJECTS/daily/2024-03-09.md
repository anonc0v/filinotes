etiology

Ulcerative colitis
- ulcer in colon
- overactive immune disorder
- most common oral manifestation: erythema

GERD:
stomach ph = 1.5-3.5
normal in oral cavity ph = 7

# Gastrointenstinal Disorders

NSAIDs inhibit the prostaglandins that protect the mucosal lining of the stomach

Gastritis
- may lead to cancer

No need to ask for medical clearance for Gastritis because it's not a big a complication as other diseases like Diabetes, CVD.  Just write the special instructions for the disorder in FASE I.

20% have problems of GERD, gastritis, ulcerative colitis.  

Acute vs Chronic Gastritis

20% in young people and 60% in old people

20-50 present in duodenum
+40 in stomach

Peptic ulcer causes
- h. pylori
- alcohol
- family history
- stress
- low levels of melatonin
- hypercalcemia
- NSAIDs
- zollinger-ellison syndrome

Prescription of NSAIDs and steroids
- aspirin, diclofenac, sulindac, indomethacin, ibuprofen, naproxen
-for 2 weeks - 5% risk
-for 4 weeks - 10% risk

NSAIDs is an etiologic factor in about 15% of cases
- directly damage mucosa, reduce musosal prostaglandin production, and inhibit mucus secretion
- ulcers caused by nsaids are located more often in the stomach than in the duodenum

Complications for peptic ulcer
- melena - blood in feces
- hematemesis - blood in vomit
- anemia - due to nutritional deficiency
Gastric Ulcer
- pain > with food
- duodenal ulcer > without food
manfiestations
- burning
- fatigue
- heartburn
- loss of appetite
- weight loss
- vomiting
- nausea
- bloating
- blurping

Gastritis and peptic ulcer treatment
- Antiacid
	- counteracts the effects of stomach acid: Aluminum hydroxide gel
	- calcium carbonate: alka-seltzer, tums
	- magnesium ydroxide: milk of magnesia
	- pepto-bismol
- Proton-pump inhibitior
	- decreases acid release in the stomach: omeprazole, lansoprazole, pantoprazole, rabeprazole, esomeprazole, dexlansoprazole
- antibiotics
	- stops growtth of or kills bacteria: penicillin, metronidazole...

Oral Manifestations
- dysgeusia.- due to xerostomia caused by medication
- erosion (tooth sensitivity)
- hyposalivation by drugs (h2 receptors: ranitidine, cimetidine)
- pale mucosa (in case of anemia)
- black tongue by bismuth intake (9reversible)

for h pylori therapy:
- 1 antiacid
- 2 antibiotics

# Colitis

- lots of different names depending on etiology
1. bacterial infection:
	-campylobacter jejuni, e. coli, salmonella, shigella, mcobacterium tuberculosis, and clostridium dificile responsible for pseudomembranous colitis
	Parasites such as Entameoba histolytica. Viruses such as cytomegalovirus
	2. inflammatory bowel disease: Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis
	3. Microscopic colitis: This condition is a relatively common cause of chronic watery diarrhea, especially in the elderly. The disase has 2 subtypes, collagenous colitis and lymphocytic colitis, which are very similar clinically with the main distinction being the presence or absence of....
4. Ischemic colitis: occurs when there is hypoperfusion in blood supply below that required for metabolic needs of the colon resulting in colonic mucosal ulceration, inflammation and hemorrhage
5. drug-induced colitis
6. secondary to immune deficiency disorders
7. tuberculous colitis
8. radiation colitis

Ulcerative colitis
Clinical Features:
- rectal bleeding
- diarrhea
- tenesmus
- abdominal pain
- fever
- fatigue
- weight loss

Histological:
- crypt distortion
- crypt abscess
- cryptitis
- lymphoplasmacytic infiltration
- mucin depletion
- crypt depletion

Causal
- microbial exposure at a young age
- diet
- seasons
- geographical location
- smoking (protective)
- appendectomy history (protective)
- use of NSAID

 Genetics
- genetic risk alleles
- family history of UC
- defects in maternal imprinted genes
- epigenetics changes
- ethnicity
- age 

Crohn's disease 
- patchy inflammation throughout small and large bowel
Ulcerative colitis (can be in any part)
	- that's why pain is everywhere
- continuous and uniform inflammation in the large bowel (ONLY IN COLON)
	- that's why pain is normally in one area

Colitis Treatment
- 5-aminosalicylic acid
- antibiotics
- immunosuppresants
- corticosteroids
- targeted syntheteic small molecules
- biologic threapies
- iron supplmeent and vitamins

Medical Management
- complementary studies
	- endoscopy, biopsy
	- seological tests (antibodies vs microoorganism)
	- Ultrasound
	- TAC
- medical history 
- Treatment
	- Antibiotics (clarithromycin, amoxicillin, metronidazole, levoflaxacin, tetracycline)
	- suppressors of gastric acids (milk of magnesia, bismuth)

Pharmacological considerations
- cimetidine
	- with anestheteics (intravascular injection): Magnified local anestheteic toxicity.
		- no need to NOT give, just be aware of complications
	- with oral antifungals: defective absorption of antifungals
- calcium, aluminum, or magnesium salts
	- w/ tetracyclines or erythromycin: antibiotics aree neot absorbed if they are given at the same time as antacids or in the next hour (intake 2 hours later)

oral findings
- aphthous lesions
- pyostomatitis vegetans
- chronic granulomatous stomatitis
- indurated tag-like lesions
- cobblestone-like gingival appearance
- granulomatous infammation of minor salivary gland ducts
- continuous lip sweelling
- extensive linear ulcers of the mucosa
- midline lip fissuring
- candidiasis
- lichenoid drug reaction

Dental Management (General)
- reefer to physician for medical clearance (diagnostic, condition, evolution, complication, prognosis)
- laboratory tests: BH (anemia). TP, TS, Platelets (Bismuth: pepto bismol)
- make sure patient takes his/her medications. (self-medication)
- avoid stress, short and effective appointments
- stressful appointments, considering anxiolytic premeditation
- avoid supine position for long pereiods
- avoid NSAIDs, assess the oral route. REcommended acetaminophen (short time). AntiCox2, (celecoxib, eterocoxib)
- Avoid medications irritant to gastric mucosa (aspirin, tetracyclines, doxycillin, clindamycin, penicillin, naproxen, ibuprofen).
- If necessary, artificial saliva, by hyposalivation (due to drugs for the control of gastritis, esophagitis). Patients use chewing gums to stimulate saliva (sugar-free, because of the risk of cavities).
- Reeflux erosion; fluoride applications and restoration of the lost dental substance.
- Patients with reflux and dysgeeusia: REcommended use of bicarbonate erinsees.
- Strict control of dentobacterial plaque in patients who have or had H. Pylori ulcer.
