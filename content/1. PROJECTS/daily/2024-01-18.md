- topical 1 min
- for supraperiosteal (local infiltration) - parallel to long axis of tooth, 5mm away from the muccobuccal fold\
- works immediately

-for PSAN - have patient partially open; b/c if it is open too wide can't see and if closed of course you cant see
- also called 2 45 degree technique 
  b/c you insert superiorly at 45 degree angle to the occlusal plane and also 45 degree medially to the sagittal plane

PSA
- depth of penetration 16mm in average skulls (remember short needle length is 20mm [[LOCAL ANESTHETICS#Needle Dimensions]]
- Over-insertion and a too distal angulation can lead to hematoma
- Areas Anesthetized:
- pulps of 1st, 2nd, and 3rd molars, except MB root of 1st Molar (28% of people have innervations\by the MSAN)
- buccal periodontium and bone overlying the teeth
- 0.9mL (half carpule)

ASA - changes line of smile
MSA (palatal approach) - does not change smile line

MSA
- insert at height of mucobuccal fold above 2nd premolar
- 0.9-1.2mL
- 3-5 min
