# Action Items

# Antibiotics 
- can be placed directly into the periodontal pocked w/ devices
- intended to release Abx into the pocket for 14 days 
- basic premise: active medications can be delivered in the site with minimal systemic intake
- are useful as adjuncts to conventional mechanical therapy
- not intended for use in place of mechanical therapy or as therapy for aggressive forms of periodontal disease

# Subgingivally Applied Agents
## Tetracycline Fibers
- first local delivery product in the US
- is a polymer ethylene vinyl fibers satured with 25% tetracycline
- marketed as a 23cm length of 0.5mm ......
- for 10 days it sustains tetracycline concentrations exceeding 1300ug/ml
- beyond the 32-64 ug/ml required for inhibiting the growth of pathogens isolated from perio pockets
- the flexible fiber is placed into the perio pocket until 1mm apical to the gingival margins
- a cord packing instrument is helpful
- the gingival margin is then sealed with isocyanocrylate
- the placement of the fiber does not require anesthesia, but SRP does 
- disadvantages
	- time consuming (10 min per tooth)
	- need of second appointment for removal
- instructions for the patient
	- do not brush
	- dot not floss specific area 
	- [[1. PROJECTS/Dentistry/Dental Materials/Chlorhexidine|Chlorhexidine]] mouth washes twice for 2 weeks
	- mouth rinses 1 week after removal

## Chlorhexidine Chip
- Perio Chip
- Biodegradable gelatin matrix
- small chip 0.35mm thickness and 4x5 in height/width
- incorporates 2.5mg of [[1. PROJECTS/Dentistry/Dental Materials/Chlorhexidine|Chlorhexidine]] self retentive on contact w/ moisture, therefore no need for dressings or adhesives
- should be placed immediately after SRP
- maintains drug concentrations in the gingival crevicular fluid of 100 mg/ul? for 7 days
- keeping the chip ante the surrounding tissues dry is helpful because of its dimensions is difficult to be placed in pockets smaller than 5mm
- patient instructed not to brush or floss for 7 days 
- chlorhexidine mouth rinses for 7 days 

Perio Chip Placement 

SRP + combination therapy +30% improvement

Doxycycline gelatin 
- atridox
- incorporates 10% of doxycycline is a liquid biodegradable polymer 
- it hardens after a few minutes following exposure to the crevicular fluid 
- levels in gingival fluid of 250 ug/ml of 7 days in the pocket 
- 2 syringes that are coupled and mixed by moving the contents back and forth for 100 cycles
- also available premixed in a syringes no extra appointment for removal tell the patient not to brush or floss for 7 days 

Minocycline microspheres
- ARESTIN in a bioabsorbable polymer as an adjunctive treatment with SRP
- 1mg minocycline 
- material is bioadhesive ion contact w/ moisture, does not need adhesives 
- patients instructed to avoid brushing for 12 hours w/ no interdental cleaning for 10 [[Templates/Daily Notes]] the drug maintains therapeutic concentrations for 14 days 

# Operative 
# Unit 3 - Black's cavity classification, Mount and Hume cavity classifications

# Criteria for the classification of Dental Caries lesions

# GV Black (1908)
- categorized carious lesions based on the type of tooth effected - Location / Surface

## Preparation rules according to Black 
1. Extension for prevention
	1. the risk of secondary caries on the prepared surface should be minimal 
2. Principles of Retention
	1. The preparation must be done in a way that the filling is not going to fall out
3. Principles of Resistance
	1. Adequate support surfaces
## Modified classifications 

## Classification by GJ Mount & Hume
- based on site/size

### Site 1 
- pits fissure, minor defects of exposed enamel surfcaes of all teeth
### Site 2
- approximal enamel surfaces...
### Site 3

#### Size 0
- initial lesion that does not present cavitation
- Presence of demineralized enamel 
#### Size 1
- Presence of opacity or surface pigmentation easily distinguishable without drying of the enamel, due to localized microcavitation. minimal dentin involvement
#### Size 2
- moderates...
#### Size 3
- long lesion w/ extensive cavity and reaches the slopes of the cusps. maybe close to pulp.
#### Size 4

Past / Present 

less conservative / more conservative

Minimal invasion
- caries management is based in analysis of the factors of initiation and progression of the disease and therefore, it integrates concepts of prevention, control and treatment. 

MI does not mean small preparations
MI means non-removal of HEALTHY tissues 
- defined by the World Congress of Minimally Invasive Dentistry as "techniques that respect the health, function and easthetics of oral tissues, preventing diseases and intercepting their progress with loss minimum of fabrics"

Rule for MInimally Invasive preparation
1. Preventive extension: The extension of the cavity outside the limits of carious hard tissue is only recommended if it improves the prognosis of the restoration
2. Contour Form: The opening of the cavity must allow reliable excavation of the caries 
3. Resistance form: This is not necessary, prepare a resistance form resistance is superfluous due to the adhesive property of the material restorer. 

Treatment - remineralization
therapeutic sealants
restorations aimed at preserve the maximum amount of dental tissue 

ICDAS
- visual

Code 1
1. Prevention 
2. Fluoride application
3. Sealants
4. Remineralization 
- ICON 
- Antivet 

Code 3 - moderate caries 
- Microcavity in dry enamel <0.5mm without visible dentin 

Tx:
1. Prevention 
2. Fisurortomy and sealants 
3. ..

Code 4 - moderate caries 
- dark shadow of dentin seen through wet enamel with or without microcavity 
- radiolucency til 1/3rd of dentin

Code 5 - extensive caries 
- dentin exposure in cavity >0.5mm...

Tx:
1. Prevention 
2. Restoration 
3. ...

Code 6 - extensive caries 
- extensive distinct cavity w/ visible dentin 
- radiolucency in the pulp, clinically

If due to NCL (noncarious lesion, like abfraction, traumatic toothbrshing) size 0 for mount and hume; ICDAS 0 (unless exposed)
