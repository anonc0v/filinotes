evaluation criteria
- 1st exam after topic i and ii completed
- 2nd exam: topic iii and IV
- final exam June 2024

surgery day
- pre-op evaluation > opg/panorex + oral examination
	- preo-op evaluation note is in nota de evolucion, click CMF then pre-op

- authorization in smile
- signed case file
- authorization of pre-op note (smile + case file) > schedule

- sterile material (complete) file review, chair & instruments preparation before patient entering

- post-op note authorization (smile + case file) > evaluation
- if need surgery, dr. fernando can come check the patient to approve surgery during DIAGNOSIS; THURSDAYS and FRIDAYS; 
	- no need for approval before authorization of SURGERY

- after authorization by Dr. fernando, px will get authorized by diagnosis, patient just needs at least 1 cleaning b4 the day of surgery

BEFORE doing anything with the patient, even anes, inform Dr. Fernando;
- show instruments
- low speed
- high speed
- elevator kit
- forcep kit
- with syringe

- if patient cancels, tell assistant 30 minutes before surgery

print prescription 2= 1 for px and 1 to case file; post op; then write note
at least 7 days after, suture removal

- 15 points per exo
- 10 points if simple exo but dr. does it
- 20 points for multiple exo

explain everything about the cyst/lesion/etc that is to be removed

General surgery principles
- hospital vs office
- who is the patient?

PREOPERATIVE ASSESMENT
1) review of previous medical report (medical, surgical and pharmacological info)
2) personal interview w/ the patient or knowledgeable guardian (CH)
3) physical examination (Cardiovascular + respiratory) - BP, HR, breathing well
4) medical tests review and referral for consultation if needed
5) determination of patient's perioperative risk - ASA I, II, III (only emergency)
6) thorough explanation of various treatment options if possible
7) informed consent

Previous medical report 
- cardiac disease
- coronary artery disease
- valvular disease
- congestive failure
- abnormalities of electrical impulse generation/conduction twave 

Cardiac disease
several risk factors for CAD have been identified including:

Cardiac disease
Resting ECG w/in a month of a planned elective surgery
- males age 35 and older
- females 45 and older
- other patients w/ a history suggestive of cardiac disease

cardiac disease
table 2-2 clinical predictors of increaesed perioperative cardiovascular risk (myocardial infarction, heart failure, death)

peterson's book

cardiac disease
-immediate postoperative ECG should be obtained in patient w/ hx of CAD esp if they have:
-syncopal episode, unexplained hypotensive
-signs of heart failure
-dysrhythmias
-angina

valvular disease

respiratory disease
- minor risk on oral maxilofacial zone involving surgery related pulmonary disease
- detect symptoms
- wheezing
- productive cough
- low exercise tolerance
- pulmonary medications
- cigarette smoking (vaping too)

Respiratory Disease
prev dx pulmonary disease
asthma
pneumonia
copd
tuberculosis
SarsCov2

respirateory disease
physical examination must include
- careful inspection of the nasal airways
- auscultation of lung fields
- nail signs for cyanosis or clubbing
- measurement of respiratory rate
radiographic assesment to identify parenchymal disase, edema, consolidations or masses (thorax or chest XRAY)

renal disease
renal insufficiency

- processes of fluid
- electrolyte
- acid-base balance
- **drug metabolism and elimination**
- blood pressure control (R-A system)
- red blood cell production (erythropoietin)
- vit D hydroxylation

endocrine disorders
diabetes mellitus
-type 1 DM
type 2 dm - most common; altered number and affinity of peripheral insulin receptors
120-200mg/dL

liver disease
- prothrombine, f. vii, ix, x, protein c, protein s
- liver produces factors
- f. I fibrinogen
- ii. prothrombine
- v. proacelerin
- vii. proconvertine
- ix. christmas
- x. stuart-prower

peterson's principle of oral and maxilo surery

- gender
- age
- consciousness
- head
	- shape
	- hair
	- eyes
	- ears
	- nose
