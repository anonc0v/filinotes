Fases
write "valorar" in Fase I if you need to check the tooth clinically for example for endo

5 exos or more = multiple exo
<5 = one by one

3 zones of oral mucosa
1. masticatory mucosa (gingive and hard palate - everything that is keratinized)
2. specialized mucosa (dorsum of the tongue)
3. oral mucous membrane (the rest of oral cavity)

- 2mm of. atttached gingigva at least to maintain gingival health
	- enough to resist trauma, brushing, etc

- mucogingival line - tells what flap you do in periodontal surgery
- separates the gum from the alveolar mucosa
- no mucogingival line (junction) in palate

marginal gingiva
- free/unattached gingiva
- terminal eds of gingiva surrounding teeth in collarlike fashion
- about 50% of cases demarcated by a shallow linear depression: free gingival groove
- coral pink or soft pink
- usually 1-2mm wide
- forms the soft tissue wall of the gingival sulcus
- in clinically healthy gingiva there may not be gingival sulcus
- psuedopocket when found, usually in younger patients with brces

Gingival sulcus

attached gingiva
- gingerally ; 3.5-4.5mm in mx and 3.3-3.9 in md
- 1.9 in mx and 1.8 in md
- when u get older, posterior width of mgj can get thicker, according to some studies

biotype before, now it's called phenotype b/c the characteeristics depend with a variety of factors including genetics, underlying bone, shape of teeth, etc
- thick vs thin
- in thin -  contact point is higher, base of interdental papilla is slimmer, harder to stitch without breaking, higher scar risk, less prominent or not visible gingival groove; prognosis for tissue replacement is lower
- in thicker - contact point is lower, base of interdental papilla is wider, easier to stitch w/o breaking, lower scar risk, gingival groove when present is more prominentm tissue prognosis for tissue replacement higher

Innterdental gingiva
anterior shape has a pyramidal shape
shape determineed by
- contact points of adjacent teeth
- CEJ shape of each tooth
- width of dental surfaces

magic rule:
- 5mm b/w contact point and crest of bone there'll be  interdental papilla
	- so if you see black spaces, probably there's something going on with interdental bone - bone loss, bony defect, etc
	- that's why in crowded teeth, there's no interdental papilla bc there's no space for the interdental bone

- 3mm b/w 2 implants vs 1.5mm b/w implant and tooth because... normal tooth has periodontal ligament and implant does not; needs more support

- posterior teeth
- - its flattened in a v-L way
- called surfaces of contact
- forms "col"
- consists of non-queratinized epitheleium

type of epithelium in oral cavity
- stratified squamous epitheeliuum
- differentiates into
	- oral/outer peithelium - faces oral cavity
	- sulcuar epithelium - faces tooth w/o being in contact w/ enamel; sulcus and crevicular fluid allow transport of antibiotics to the pocket/tooth
	- junction epithelium - in contact w/ tooth and gingiva; termination of sulcus; 
- function - protect deep structures while allowing selective interchange w/ the oral environment

Oral epithelium
- covers the creest, the outer surface of the marginal gingiva and attached gingiva
- it is keratitnized = stratified squamous keratinized eptihelium
- variations of keratinization:
	- 1) palate
	- 2) gingiva
	- 3) ventral aspect of the tonuge
	- 4) cheeks
