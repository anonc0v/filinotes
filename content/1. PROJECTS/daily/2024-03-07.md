pigmented lesions due to increased melanogenesis
- physiologic (racial) melanosis
- frictional (post-inflammatory) melanosis
- smoker's melanosis
- drug-ind

physiologic (racial) melanosis
- persistent
- **usually symmetric**
- increase with advancing age
- bothgenders equally affected
- more common in gingiva, buccal mucosa and tongue (lateral borders)
- erutpin is the leading cause of inflammation, which axtivated melanocytes to produce melanin in attached gingiva

fricitional melanosis
- hyperpigmentation assoc. to mechanical trauma or to chronic inflammatory conditions
- usually asymptomatic, but may be some burning sensation due to inflammation
- most common in labial mucosa and tongue
- if there is a hyperkeratosis/white lesion but there are pigmented areas of mucosa around, it's possible that it's just trauma/frictional melanosis

mouth breathers can develop enlarged/inflamed gingiva

Smoker's melanosis
- usually diffuse or asymmmetric patches
- intensity of pigmentation related to dose and duration of the habit
- occasionally associated to other tobacco-related conditions
- more commonly found in anterior vestibular gingiva, buccal mucosa and palate
- scc directly related to smoking

Melanotic macules
- focal melanosis w/o increase in the number of melanocystes
- when multiple: may be sign of several diseases
- isolated: more common in vermilion border of lower lip and gingiva in association to chronic traums

Peutz-Jeghers syndrome
- rare hereditary disoreder (1:120,000)
- 35% are new mutations (means no hx of affected family)
- multifocal, perio-oral, intra-oral, and cutaneous (fingers of the hand) melanotic macules
- onset in childhood
- may develop hamartomatous polyps in gastro-intestinal mucosa (jejuno and ileum) that eventually may cause intussusception, necrosis an dperitonitis
- 2%-3# develop adenocarcinoma
	- therefore, needs followup for the rest of their life every 1-2 years (endoscopy)
- **18-fold risk for developing cancer**

Clinical case
- 39 years old male
- patient under chemotherapy due to metastatic colon adenocarcinoma (metastasis in live and bones)
- sent for stomatological evaluation to prevent and/or teat oral mucosal alterations 
- -dr. fabio ramoa pires. uerj, brasil
- died
- disease starts during childhood
- dentists have the opportunity and responsiblity to perform early diagnosis and derive to toher medical specialities for a correct evaluation and followup

Clinical case
- 58 year-old female
- recent onset of pigmentations in oral cavity that looks similar to peutz-jegers syndrome
- Laugier-Hunziker syndrome
	- benign non-hereditary disorder
	- multipole brown to black macules in labial and buccal mucosaf
	-  frequent association to longitudinal melanonychia and genital melanosis
	- absence of systmneic disease

Pigmented NEvi
- tumor-like malformations of the melanin-producing (naevic) cells
	- junction
	- compound
	- intramucosal
	- blue

Pigmented Nevi
Differential diagnosis
- melanotic macule
- metallic (amaglam) tattoo
- venous lake (phlebectasia)
- kaposi's sarcoma
- melanoma

Melanoma ABCD
- A=asymmetry
- B=irregular borders
- C=color (multiple) - camoflage pattern
- D= Dimension > 6mm
- survival oral mucosa - 25% survival rate
- oral melanoma in children very rare

oral mucosal melanoma
- Clinico-pathological classification (for therapeutic and prognostic purposes):
- - superficial spreading melanoma (horizontal growth)
- nodular (invasive) melanoma (vertical growth)

oral mucosal melanoma
- 1%-2% of all melanomas
- oral mm 1.2 cases per 10 million inhab/year
- more than 80% hard palate and upper gingiva
- unkown etiology
- most cases in >40years old
- no gender predilection
	- can rub with a gauze and there'll be some pigmentations (if it was racial, the melanin is INSIDE the epithelium (basal layer; the melanocytes are in the connecxtive tissue) but in OMM it can travel to the outer surface)

Treatment
-surgical excision w/ free margins
radiotherapy (questionable)
chemothereapy (no better survival)
- immunotherapy (Il-2), etc) (some useful in cutaneous melanoma)
- vaccines in process (experimental)

pigmented lesions due eto causes not related to melanin
- metallic tattoo

Amiodorone pigmented lesion assoiated with rpd?

Bismuth-related pigmentation - pepto bismol

# Red Lesions
Causes:
- Erythema
- Mucosal atrophy
- Increased vascularity (e.g Hemangiomas)
- Hemorrhagic lesions (haemotamos, bullous hemorrhagic angina, etc).

Clinical case
- 58 yo woman
- 4 mo history of burning of the oral mucosa withouth apparent reason
- history of breast cancer successfully treated 10 years b4 with combined surgery and chemotherapy. (significance: not related to the recent lesion)
- patient denies use of medication, toxic substances, mouthwashes, etc. 

- patient 2
	- the red areas are denuded/atrophied areas and can eventually lead to ulcerations

What to do?
- good description
- systemic exanination (skin GI tract, etc.)
- presumptive diagnosis
- conplementary studies to confirn ad efinitive diagnosis

special tests
- exfoliative citology
- **haemogram**
- **blood smear**
- blood chemistry screen
- most important are the ones in bold

case 1:
haemogram findings
- , it was determined that she has anemia, (erythrocytes less, but larger sized, more haemoglobin but non-functioning / dysfunctional, increaee of lymphocytes - meaning there's a chronic infection); 
- globular sedimentation speed - fast; so the RBCs are heavy, perhaps with additional proteins attached
cytological smear
- anisocitosis
- macrocitosis
- basofilia difussed areas
- rouleaux (rbc in line or train-formation)
	- lack of oxygen and nutrients to other cells
- Vitamin B-12 deficiency based on finidng of 85 pg/mL; regular is 187 to 883 pg/mL
	- causes: diet, neoplasia in digestive tract, etc
Pernicious Anemia: Diagnosis 

what do i do?
- to define treatment:
	- correct predisposing factors
	- prevent compiications

Case 2:
42 yo woman w/ 2 month history of burning mouth
- enlarged tongue, evidenced by scalloped border of tongue
- pain in tongue, 
- chronic gastritis
	- red lesions on soft palate
- lesions of the buccal mucosa
- presumptive diagnosis: pernicious aneamia
	- biopsy: irregular cells; atypical nuceli due to B12 deficient cells, hyperchromatic cells-

Case 3:  Case 4:
-microlobulated tongue due to xerostomia

angular chelitis + atrophy of the tongue = candida infection
- ired areas on tongue can spread infection to palate
- hyphae seen microscopically

Case 5:
- red areas in the center of tongue
- palate is also red
- contact of tongue eto palate can innoculuate the palat 

Benign migratory glossitis
- aka geographic tongue
- 2-3% of whole population
-  commmon 2-3% of population affected
- early desquamation of upper layers of epithelium in several areas of the tongue surface
- map-like or geographic pattern that migrates from one zone to another in, with peripheral inflammation that may produce pain with spicy or acid foods
- biopsy not necessary (clinical diagnosis), but useful in some cases
- **more prevalent in patients with psoriasis (12%)**
- frequently assoc. with fissured tongue (older patients) - may develop this due to repeated bouts of inflammation
- red areas = atrophic
- white areas = deesquamated
- frequently misdiagnosied as candidosis

Megaloblastic anemia can calso cause red lesions of the tongue

Case 6
- burning sensation at tip of tongue
- rest of tongue is normal
- on inner lower lip, there's white araes that can be detached with gauze
- the epithelium detaches from mucosa due to:
	- toxic substances, strong mouthwash, strong toothpaste (sodium lauryl sulfate is a detergent that some patients are sensitive to it)
- another patient with lobulations in lower lip
- contact stomatitis, similar to contact dermatitis, contact w/ external substance causing a reaction in body
- ask what they drink/eat/toothpaste use

Case 7
- very dry mouth
- angular cheilitis
- in mexico causes of dry mouth from first to 3rd leading causes:
	- Medication
	- Diabetes
	- Sjogren's syndrome?
- functions of salive: niewu amerongen AV, veerman El. oral dis. 2002/3? 8-..

common sequale of lac of salica
- candidosis
- atrophic clossitis
- burnign sensation (s-bms)
- sepech and swallow difficulties)
- digestive disorders
- dysgeusia
-produces lobulated surface and redness due to inflammation

Stenson's duct observation in xerostomic px : saliva may be thicker/whiter, duct may be infected

erythroplakia
- red area with no explanation 
	- need biopsy
	- b/c most erythroplakia has some degree of dysplasia >>> precancerous

Oral ulceration - 6 possibilities in order of frequency
- traumatic (80-90%)
- recurrent aphtous stomatitis (autoimmune disease)
- drug-related 
- infectious diseases
- neoplasms (usually malignant)
- systemic diseases

Common causes of traumatic ulceration
- natal teeth (riga-fede disease or traumatic granuloma)
- bites
- protheesis and other intra-oral applicances
- post-anaesthesia
- physical and chemical burns
- factitious - psychological disorder?, self-producing

Case 1
- apthous stomatitis is usually well defined and clean surface
- this surface is not cleann has granulation slight on surface
- irregular shape - triangular - sharp border of denture

Traumatic ulceration
suggest management:
- identify and correct the causative agent
- pain control and general measures
- promote food intake
- prevent infection

case 2
- lateral border of tongue ulceration - 2 months
- ulcer is not clean in center
- hyperkeratotic border (consistent with cancer but other observations were made so was not first/preliminary diagnosis)
- not increased in size in 1 week
- touch lesion to seee if there's thickening/hardness
- saw RFs in contact with lesion that may cause (presumptive agent) the trauma
- removal of RFs, cured the lesion in 1 week

- pain control:
	- 
- analgesics (paracetamol) in paediatric patients
- topical anesthetics (benzocaine (7-20%- DO NOT USE))
- chlorhexidine gluconate
- mucosal protective agaents (kaolin-pectin suspension) mixed in equal parts with antihistamine syrup (benadryl)
- hialuronic acid compounds (bexident AFT)
- corticoseteroids
