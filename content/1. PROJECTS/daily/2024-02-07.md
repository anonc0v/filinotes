cambios tisulares en la pulpa dental provocados por caries
la caries a pesar de todas las medidas profilacticas es todavia la enfermedad mas prevalente en el ser humano
"langeland k tissue response to dental caries. dental traumatology 1987" #journal/endo

corelaninon - tooth biology; pulp heat response

la etiologia de la inflamacion pulpar en caries superficial debe ser considerado el resultado de metabolitos y productos de destruccion de las bacterias, productos de desintegracion de los procesos odontoblasticos y del fluido titular en los tubulos dentinarios 
"langeland - tissue response to dental caries"

odontoblasts can be aspirated into dentinal tubules by presence of irritant like bacteria (from caries); after they degenerate; they will be replaced in the pulp by another cell and try to form hard tissue

brown & brumm modified by taylor - type of histological stain

irratative dentin 

before inflammation, there's hyperemia, where the blood vessels enlarge in preparation to help the defense cells to come

ricucci - hard tissue formation

exposición pulpar por caries

"kakehashi, stanley 1965 - los efectos de exposiciones quirurgicas de pulpas dentals en ratas de laboratorio libres de germenes y convencionales" #journal/endo

ricucci - correlación between clinical and histological pulp diagnoses.
pulp cap under rubber dam and being gentle with tissues will have a higher success rate; advocated by ricucci

la ocurrencia de un foco de necrosis, a pesar de extensión limitada, asociada con colonización bacteriana, representa desde un punto de vista histologico la transicion de pulpitis irreversible.

at the area of focal necrosis, there's acute inflammation with inflammatory cells and necrotic tissue, further away into the pulp, there's a mix of mixed inflammation, and a further away there's healthy tissue.

 definition of vital pulp = fibrous continuous and bleeding tissue

dentinoclasts - causes irregularities in the canal wall due to hard tissue formation

formación de la lesión periapical
2 types: cyst or granulanoma
- granuloma - area where bacteria comes to be killed and not to proliferate; rich in inflammatory cells so bacteria will be killed (mainly by neutrophils)
- but of course there are some cases of periapical infection (will discuss later)
- periapical lesions are immune responses
- the. body prepares the army at the pericapical area because there's no collateral circulation within the canal
- granuloma is a filter to prevent bacteria from going into the general circulation
- when you see a periapical lesion, it doesn't automatically mean that the pulp tissue is necrotic; it could be that there's inflammation but the pulp is still vital

Sundqvist goran 1976,
bacteriological studies of necrotic dental pulps
-recupero 88 cepas bacterianas (83 anaerobios) en casos agudos flora microbiana compleja y siempre presente bacteroides malalinogenicus (now it's called porphyromonas and prevotella)
conclusions - size of periapical lesion corresponds to bacterial load; 

neutrophils - half-life 7 hours
doubling time of bacteria = 20 min

abcess is an acute reaction that develops from a cyst or granuloma

microbiology of periapical granulomas - chris iwu 1990 #journal/endo 

desarrollo de una lesión periapical predecible monitoreada

absence of radiometric differentiation b/w periapical cysts and granulomas - white 1994 #journal/endo 

Bhaskar - important indian resesarcher who was also a colonel; was in first edition of ingle's cohen's pathways of the pulp

cysts formation in relation to endo lesions are between 10-15%; therefore, most are granulomas

even if there are cysts, the neutrophils are able to penetrate through the epithelium and kill bacteria

nair - indian researcher who did his research in switzerland; nice electro microscope slide

after RCT treatment, the epithelial cells will be eaten by the body allowing capillaries to go into the area and heal

lesiones periapicales incidencia de quistes(cysts)

as clinicians, we dry the river (root canal) which will get rid of the lake (periapical lesion) - Dr. 

Quiste periapical verdadero "una lesión periapical inflamatoria con una cavidad patologica distinta completamente recubierta de epitelio sin comunicacion existente con el conducto radicular."  - Dr. argues it's not true since cells can penetrate the cyst and definitely the granuloma

true versus bay apical cysts: clinical, radiographic histopathologic and histobacteriologic features

- [ ] why do cholestorol clefts form im granulomas/cysts?

trauma can cause necrosis b/c the blood vessels at the apical end cutting of the circulation to the tooth; bacteria can come from microcracks (higher chance than anachoresis) through the teeth or through anacheresis (bacteria from circulation enter the root canal)

current recommendations for prophylactic antibiotics - give 30 min to 1 hr before treatment to protect patient against the bacteria that may circulate during treatment (it's NOT to cure the abcess)
- artificial heart valve
- heart infact in previous 6 mo

the river (end of root at the minor constriction) is in the center of the lake

histobacteriologic conditions of the apical root system and periapical tissues in teeth associated with sinus tracts - Domenico ricucci 
-patient with sinus tract - in 71% of cases have periradicular biofilm
- but RCT still works, which means that the main source of the main cause was in the root canal (in most cases; 81% success rate of RCT of endodontic infections with sinus tract)
- even in chronic cases like with sinus tract, there are presence of acute defense cells - neutrophils (first line of defense)

# DIAGNOSTICO

- basis for correct diagnosis is so you can select the correct treatment
- AAE consensus conference on diagnostic terminology; background and perspectives

Lesiones pulpares
- reversible
- irreversible

Medios de Diagnóstico
radiografía
- in xrays, the canal should be in the center; if the canal is not in the center, it means that there is another canal in the root; take a SHIFTED xray 
- in the upper molar, if there is already a completed rct treatment and you see a lesion associated with the mesial root, most likely it's a missed canal

limitation of radiography:
seltzer & bender 1965 - to be able to see clearly, more than 60% of the calcium has to be destroyed (demineralization) has to take place

- pain means the pulp exposed; but pulp exposure doesn't always mean pain
- most imp't question is **what causes the pain**
- never use water or air for cold test because it can jump to other teeth
- use ice at the most distal tooth 
- you can do test with an ice -3 degrees centigrade; ethyl chloride (endo ice) is -35 degrees centigrade, dry ice (frozen CO2) is -75 centigrade (when they are not sensitive to cold due to large restorations of if they have crowns)
	- because it is overkill/sadistic; if patient feels it with just -3 centigrade why do something even colder and cause more pain
- normal pulp : if you do cold test, the pain goes away immediately after you withdraw it (with ice)
- these thermal tests are called sensitivity tests not vitality tests
- watch out for referred pain, where usually it is from mandi to maxi (not other way around)

anderson, langeland - criterios diagnosticos para el tratamiento de pulpitis inducida por caries; dentists from us navy; naval dental research institute in the netherlands
- dolor prolongado despues de remover estimulos termicos, electricos o de percusion, es indicativo de enfermedad pulpar irreversible.

fracturas y fisuras longitudinales
-longitudinal tooth cracks and fractures: an update and revie - Rivera, walton #journal/endo 

- las fisuras y fracturas longitudinales son hallazgos, no diagnostico. los tejidos pulpares y periapicales usualmente no estan afectados, sin embargo con comunicacion pulpar permite...
- las fisuras y fracturas ocurren por fuerzas excesivas, usualmente aunque no siempre a largo plazo
- las fisuras pueden ser dificiles de visualizar
- los espacios de fractura tienden a adquirir tinciones y/o restos, por lo que pueden hacerse mas visibles con el tiempo
- una pequena fisura tiende a crecer con el tiempo, generalmente en forma lenta. analogiaa del parabrisas
- signos y sintomas clinicos no estan presentes al principio, pero se pueden manifestar despues de una semana, mes, un ano o decadas de la fractura
- craze line - no tx?

sindrome del diente fisurado - dr. arriola disagrees with this; there are symptoms b/c the reason isn't b/c of the fracture but b/c of bacterial infiltration through the crack

ricucci - the cracked tooth: histopathologic and histobacteriologic aspect #journal/endo 
- shows bacteria in the crack with large amount of neutrophils surrounding the bacteria entering the pulp, causing pulpal necrosis in the same way as in a pulp exposure through cavity
- there may or may not be pain

fracture necrosis: diagnosis, prognosis assessment, and treatment recommendations - Berman, 2010 #journal/endo 
- pulp became infected through a crack
- if patient starts developing pain, then it's already irreversible
- read the conclusion
-  

- an elongated periodontal lesion + probing may indicate a crack though the tooth (instead of just being located at the very apex of the tooth it extends more)
- sometimes there's no perio probing because the crack may be in the apical 2/3rds of the root (for example, due to lateral condensation; so be careful!)
- sometimes you can just use an instrument to check if there's a fracture below a crown (use spoon excavator to retract the gingiva and visualize the start of the crack)

J-shaped lesion - Dr. Arriola disagrees with this concept that it represents a fracture
- a fracture would have it on both sides (more like a U-shaped lesion)
