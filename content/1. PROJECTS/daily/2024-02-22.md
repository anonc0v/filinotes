- neuroplasticity
- stomatognathic system has the ability to adapt or compensate for deviations by limiting itself in relation nto magnitude of muscle function acording to ite remaining dental mechanoceptive-proprioceptive demand
occlusion- relationships of chewingn surfaces of teeth of upper arch to lower when makign contact

masticatory system debate:
teeth annd tmj: guide
muscles - move
ligaments; limit
Central nervous system: coordinate and control

occlusal morphology
elevatiosn:
- cusps
- cingulum
- marginal edge
- marginal ridge
depressions:
- fossa
- grooves

functionnal cusps
- maitnain VD
- chewing
Cusps guide
- reduce shock with tissues and mainntain food bolus
- mandibular stability and guidance

VIPS - functional cusps
-buccal cusps of posterior mand teeth and palatal cusps of posteiror mx teeth are occluded w/ the areas of the antagonist HR

guidie cusps.  cutter cusps
- the buccal cusps of posterior maxillary teeth and the lingual cusps of the posterior md teeth

volume of the cusps
functional cusps / guide cusps
60% / 40%

occlusal contacts - areas of the occlusal and incisal surfaces that are evidenced by contacting the chewing surfaces of the teeth of the upper arch with the teeth of the lower teeth
proximal contacts - they are areas of the mesial or distal aspect of a tooth that touches the adjacent tooth in the same arch. these areas vary depending on the size of the proximal surfaces of each part in contact.

interocclusal contacts
according to their function, the contacts can be divided by their **mesio-distal stability** into:
- stoppers
- stabilizers
due to their **vestibule-lingual stability**, they can be divided
- a contacts
- b contacts
- c ctonacts

stoppers
- it stops the closure of the jaw and neutralizes the forces exerted by the balancers
- they usuually found on marginal edges

stabilizers
- balance the forces exterted by the closign stoppers, allowing stability in the mesio-distal sense

A - nonfunctional + functional
B - functional + functional
C - funcional + nonfunctional

tripodism
the three contact points obtained by each stamping cusp when it rests on its corresponding fossa
- for this to happen, there must be at least 3 contacts in both premolars and molars

when installing crowns, you check the bite w/ articulatingn paper; find 3 points; have patient bite slow; when they bite and there's no jaw movement theen you can just polish; but if when the patient bites, there's a sliding or jaw movement then you adjust occlusion;

The high point will transmit the other color (blue with some red)
- so if you insert the articulating paper such that the red on top and blue on bottom
- high point will be blue with some red

Better to have thin paper and one color
- high point will look like a ring

mutually protected occlusion - only on teeth; 
mutually shared occlusion - forces are distributed amongst teeth, muscles, tmj - the whole system
- achieved by:
	- orthodontics
	- full mouth rehabilitation
		- include nightguard (wear all day except when eating)

Opening movement
- it begins with a rotation in the inframenniscal area until the incisors are separated (approx. **20mm**) w/ the action of the depressor muscles
rotation - this movement occcurs w/in a limited opening of **25mm**
gliding/translation: this ovement begins when the jaw exceeds **25mm** opening
Maximum opening: 45-66mm
going past may have dysfucnction

opening-closing two phases:
Pure rotation movement
translation movement + rotation

protrusion-retrusion
protrusion
retrusion

Anterior guidance
Lateral movement
-When moving to one side, the opposite condyle (swing side) moves down, forward and in thee middle

lateral movement
out: "Laterotrusion" (to the working side) the condyle moves outward
inside: "mediotrusion" (the balance side) the condyle has a downward middle and forward movement

Posselt-Diagram
- dynamic intermaxillary relationships
- record that graphs the movements

Sagital
limits in saggital view

 Centric relation

Parafunction
- not all parafunctions are bad

Bruxism
Pathophysiological factors
RMMA - rapid eye movements
Night bruxism - body tries to create endorphins
neurotransmitter alterations - 5HT / serotonin

TMD 
- muscular
- articular

masticatory muscles have lots of fibers; when amuscle contracts it supposed to contract thewhole muscles; the fiber also has microfibers (tubules?) and you'll have a sustained contraction; the point of sustained contraction (contraction knots) will send signals to the insertion (normally) but since some muscles share insertions, you can experience referred pain in another muscle; 
Pain in TMJ- pterygoid muscles

-trigger points release techniques - dry puncture - deeper; in nodule

Co-contraction

Fibromialgia

Masseter - Suprahyoid muscle - sternocleido msc - intercostal + muscle in back

night guards - 4 - 6 points; from the canines and from one or more of incisors

muscular splint
- seat condyle until CR

alila medical media
-retrodiscal tissue can become a disc and become a pseudodisc; that swhy in some cases tmd problem can resolve by itself

sinovitis
-palpate 4 points around condyle

tmd problems - is a progressively degenerative disorder; so we can only stop it; inform patient

muscular guard - 6 points in antereior ; needle contact in posterior

nightguards
-MORA = bite is edge to edge; can use 60 thickness; 2-3 weeks; creates space in condyle
-Pivotante - flat plane w/ a small piece of acrylic in the posterior - 

if disk goes to external part of tmj - it will be stuck between the capsule and condyle
if internal - it will get stuck between the glenoid cavity and condyle

in occlusion; A and C points relieve pressure/create space on E side of picture (which is of the right); B point relieve pressure on on I side
- so when patient relieves pain upon jaw movement ot left; you try to create same in condyle

when you open; condyles not only go forward and down but open a bit outwards too
- the condyle that goes outward more and the deviation will have the problem)
