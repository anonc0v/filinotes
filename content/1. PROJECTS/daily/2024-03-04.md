Cushing's syndrome
- hypercorticolism
	- excess amounts of cortisol

Addison's disease
- hyperpigmentations in oral cavity

# Endocrine Disorders

### Adrenal Glands
- on top of the kidney
- cortex - external
- medulla - internal
	- adrenaline
	- norepinephrine
- cortex
	- aldosterone
	- cotrisol
	- androgen
	- estrogen

### Mineralicorticoids
Androgens and estrogens

### Cortisol
- inhibits inflammation
- promotes breakdown of fat
- reduces bone formation
- counteracts insulin
- glucose generation (liver)
- REGULATION: through the HPA axis
	- Hypothalamus >>CRH >> Pituitary gland >> ACTH >> Adrenal Gland >> Cortisol

During stress, HPA axis stimulated >>> cortisol

### synthetic glucocorticoids
- used in medicine for rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, organ transplant

Increase - cushings
decreased - addison's

Cushing's
Causes
- exogenous
	- big doses of steroid therapy
- endogenous
	- tumors of adrenal or pituitiary gland
Symptoms
- Moon face
- weight gain
- buffalo hump
- hypertension
- weakness
- osteoporosis
- hirsutism

Do not treat patient/s witthout clearance
- glucose level
- blood pressure
- good pain control / no stress

Radiation treatment
- check oral manifestations
Surgical excision can cause a decrease or lack of cortisol
Take blood pressure
Active Cushing's syndrome only urgent aspect and preventive activities

# Addison's Disease
- Adrenal insufficiency
- Primary adrenocorticol insufficiency (Addison's disease) - adrenal cortex is destroyed or gland is removed
- secondary adrenocortical insufficiency - lack of responsiveness of adrenal glands to ACTH
- tertiary adrenal insufficiency - caused by chronic iuuse of corticosteroids

Not enough hormones of cortisol and aldosterone

### Etiology
- Autoimmune diseaseees
- infectious diseases (tuberculosis, fungal, HIV)
- neoplastic diseases
- neonatal or genetic conditions

Prolonged corticosteroid use suppresses the HPA axis, inhibiting aACTH production and adrenocortical production of cortisol

Treatment modification of steorid therapy to minimize adrenal suppression is the alternate - day regimen

### Signs and symptoms
- hypotension
- anorexia

### Oral Manifestations
- Pigmenation
- Delayed bonne growth and dental eruption
- candidiasis
- osteoprosis

Adrenal criss
- patient does not have ability to increase cortisol to manage stress, so the patient may present with
	- hypotension or shock
	- vomiting
	- abdominal pain
	- fever
	- mental status changes
		- confusion >>> coma
- management:
	-  100mg of hydrocortisone or 4mg dexamethasone IV and transportation to medical facility
- BEFORE TREATMENT
	- give steroids (not to all patients, just to those with increased risk for adrenal crisis)

Glucocorticoid replacement is based on 3 factors:
1) duration and severity of surgery and level of pain control
2) amount 

consider equivalence because we have a guidline:
- patient's taking doses of steroids greater than 30 mg of hydrocortisone or its equivalent (>5mg of prednisone)
- Long term steroids therapy, more than 30mg of hydrocortisone the last 3 months
- patient's who have less than a month of having stopped the use of corticosteroid 
- they are under the scheme of alternate intake every other day if the patient has a surgery on the day off from taking steroids.

Dental management
Patient past history of systemic corticosteroid use
a. evaluate the patient
b. determine whether systemic corticosteroid was taken within the past 2 weeks and the reason for discontinuing usage.
c. determine type, dose, and duration..

Steroid supplmenetation
REcommendations for Steroid supplmeneation During Surgery

Dental management
- determine risk of adrenal insufficiency (a history of TB or HIV)
- take blood pressure at each appointment
- confirm patient has taken the steroid dose w/in 2 hours of the surgical procedure
- work in the moring (when normal cortisol levels are highest)
- consider risk of peptic ulcer, analgesic selection should not include aspirin or NSAIDs
- discontinue drugs therapy that decrease cortisol levels at least 24 hours before surgery
- adequate pain control
- stress reduction measures
- nitrous oxide- oxygen inhalation and benzodiazeping sedation are helping in nininninzing stress and nninimizing cortisol demand
- make an appointment w/ the patient every 2 or 3 weeks - not every day  - for patients under steroid supplmeentation

# Steroid Supplmeenation - Martha

- Cushing's disease - excess of steroids
- addison's disease - deficiency of steroids

hypothyroidis - low T4, high TSH
hyper - high T4, low TSH

oral manifestations
- periodontal issues, inc susceptibility to cares
- burning mouth sydrome
- dental eruption is faster

# Thyroid Gland 
- 2nd most common glandular disorder of the endocrinen system

Secretion:
Hypothalamus releases TRH...

Treatmennt - Levoythryroxine (T4)

Dental Management
- Unstable individuals, only systemic management. In emergency control managed in a hospital setting.
- Stressful situations (cold, infections, perations, trauma) may precipiatate a hypothryoid myxedema coma in untreated ypothyroid patient
- Patients with untreated hypothyroidism are sensitive to the action of narcotics, barbiturates, and tranquilizers.  These drugs must be used with caution.
- slower and poorer healing
- strict hygiene and plaque control procesess
- priority to fixed prosthesis over removable ones (to avoid candida albicans reservoirs)
- Levothyroxine increases the sensitiivty to adrenaline receptors and the use of local anesthetics w/ epinnephrine can lead to episodes of coronary insufficiency)
- short appointments, check vital signs, make sure patient took their levothyroxine, use the lesser concentration of epinephrine

# hyperthyroidism
- symptoms
- exphthalmos) - ophthalmopathy
- goiter
- heat inntolerance
- excessive sweating
- rapid heart rate, anxiety
- irritability, depression and mood swings humor
- high blood pressure
- weight loss

Treatment:
- beta-blockers (to treat immediate symptoms)
	- propanolol or Atenolol - interacts with epinephrine
- anti-thyroid drugs 
	- Thionamides: carbamizole, methimazole, propylthiouracil - ok with epinephrine
- radioioidnine therapy (partially or completely destroy thyroid function)
- Thyroid removed with surgery

Oral and facial manifestations

Thyroid storm
- can see this in a patient that is not in control or did not take their medicine

Dental Management
- short appointments
- take blood pressure
- no epinephrine in patient not in control

Adverse reaction to propylthiouracil include agranulocytosis, leukopenia, hypoprothrombinemia
