Radiology in Pediatric dentistry

- roentgen discovered xrays in 1895
- selection of radiographs depends on age

psychological techniques
"Tell show do"

distal of 1st molar - most common site of caries
class V - canines
Anteriors - proximal

a) primary dentition - if the proximal surfaces of the primary teeth cannot be visually and tactilely inspected
b) early transitional dentition - 6-9 yo - mixed dentition: radiographs to evaluate the prescence of interproximal caries, developmental anomalies of teeth, and pathologic conditions of the hard and soft tissues of the mouth, jaws, and associated structures

- soft palate - xray

** types of findings anticipated as criteria

#pedo/examqs
purpose of bitewings: interproximal caries

at birth: skull:face 2:1 size proportion
teeth helps with vertical growth of face
growth 2-6 years old is very rapid
-when the 1st inferior molar erupts, 85% growth transverse is done 

9-12 yo - almost 85-90% height of face is complete
3 years old - 70% height of face

#pedo/examqs
**upper central**
**lower central**

delay in eruption is more abnormal

mesiopalatal cusp of upper E fits in central fossa of lower E (like permanent 1st molar)

breastfeeding, hard food, genetics important for dental development

7 years old - ugly duckling "patito feo" phase

#pedo/examqs 
**sequence of eruption** of pedo 1-5 on slide
