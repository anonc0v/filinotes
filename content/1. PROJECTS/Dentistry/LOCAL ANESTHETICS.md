 # Amides
 Metabolism: Liver; P450 enzyme???
 ```
Lidocaine (Xylocaine) - safest for children
Bupivicaine (Marcaine) - NOT safe for children
Mepivicaine (carbocaine, Polocaine) - causes least vasodilation
Articaine (Septocaine) - has one ester chaine
Prilocaine (Citanest) - methemglobinemia

```


# Esters
Metabolism: Plasma by pseudocholinesterase
- more toxic/allergic reactions due to methylparabens
 ```
Procaine - greatest vasodilation
Cocaine - vasoconstrictor
Tetracaine
Benzocaine

```

# Toxicity

```
• Max epinephrine for ASA I patient= **0.2mg**  
• Max epinephrine for cardiac patient= **0.04mg**  
• Max lidocaine without vasoconstrictor= **4.4mg/kg** 
• Max lidocaine with vasoconstrictor= **7mg/kg**
```

# Needle Dimensions

```
• Length  
– Short= 20mm 
– Long= 32mm

• Diameter  
– 30-gauge= 0.3mm 
– 27-gauge= 0.4mm 
– 25-gauge= 0.5mm
```


# MANDIBULAR TECHNIQUES
IAN
- 20-25mm - needle insertion
-  does not anesthetize buccal posterior soft tissue
	- u need the long buccal
	- the foramen of the IAN is halfway b/w the pterygomandibular raphe and the coronoid notch
	- the target is halfway between the formen and pterygomandibular raphe (just lateral)
	- accessorry innervation by the mylhohyoid nerve
	- 1.5 mL deposited 
## GOW GATES
landmarks:
extraoral
- corner of mouth
- tragus; intertragic notch - lower border
intraoral
- below the ML cusp of Mx 2nd Molar![[Landmarks Gow Gates.png]]![[Landmarks Gow Gates 2.png]]
- deposit 1.8mL but if only partial anesthsia is achieved deposit another 1.2mL

## AKINOSI
-bevel faces midline b/c nerves are there 

## MENTAL 
-5mm deep
-0.6mL (1/3rd)
-foramen usually closer to apex of 2nd premolar
-no need to penetrate INTO the foramen


## INCISIVE
-after press on the foramen for 1-2 min
-0.6mL
-no need to penetrate INTO the foramen
