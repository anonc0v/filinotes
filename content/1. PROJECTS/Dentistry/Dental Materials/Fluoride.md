Accepted types of fluorides
The accepted active ingredients are: 
a.  Sodium fluoride (NaF). Dentifrices containing 850-1,150 ppm (parts per million of fluoride in the formulation.
b.  Sodium monofluorophosphate (MFP). Dentifrices containing 850-1,150 ppm and 1,500 ppm.  
c.  Stannous fluoride (SnF2). Dentifrices containing 850-1,150 ppm.

## Toxicity of Flouride

To avoid acute toxicity, package should contain <276mg of Fluoride 

There is **no risk of acute fluoride toxicity from ingestion of fluoride toothpaste** by young children, because the amount necessary to reach the **dose probably toxic (DPT = 5.0 mg F/kg body weight)** is very high; in fact, no cases have been reported in the literature. Fluoride toothpaste is one of the possible risk factors for dental fluorosis based on amount of toothpaste dispensed, amount ingested, age, and frequency and duration of use. Evidence shows that if at all the resulting levels of fluorosis are mild and do not affect the quality of life of children. Current recommendations for young children therefore suggest a ”smear/rice sized” (for children below 3 years) and “pea sized” amount for young children. Limitation of package size and maximum fluoride content for a single unit and supervision of children to avoid ingestion the toothpaste slurry are the key risk mitigation measures recommended.35
