Periodontal disease–related nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis: An emerging concept of oral-liver axis
Ryutari Kuraji, et. al 2021
# Background
- Possible association between the oral cavity and liver
	- Nutrients absorbed enters systemic circulation through fine capillaries surrounding the walls of the small intestine.  
	- These capillaries merge with veins that ultimately enter the liver through the portavein. 
	- The liver removes bacteria and further breakdown the nutrients then recirculates for usthroughout the body.
	-  Inflammatory mediators from inflamed periodontal tissues can enter circulation
	- P. gingivalis plays a role in the development of periodontitis by altering the normal microbiota to a dysibiotic state (Hajishengallis, et al. 2011) - Lindhe, Clinical Periodontology and Implant Dentistry
	- P. gingivalis also may be involved in the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease through gut dysbiosis
- Directions of Research
	- 1990s-2000s
		- bidirectional association between poor oral hygiene and preiodontal disease and chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis
	- 2000s
		- possible involvement of systemic inflammation and oxidative stress from periodontitis in the development of Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease 
	- 2010s
		- possible invovlement of P. gingivalis
			- gut-liver axis and gut dysbiosis
	- late 2010s (systematic reviews and meta-analyses)
		- epidemiology and in vivo research  
## Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease 
### Definition:
- >5% of hepatocytes are fatty
- lack common causes of secondary hepatic fat accmulation such as:
	- excessive alcohol conumption
	- chronic viral hepatitis
	- autoimmune hepatitis
	- medications that caue steatosis
	- congenital hepatic disorders
### Classification
1. *Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver* (NAFL/Simple steatosis)
	- favorable prognosis
2. *Nonalcoholic stetohepatitis*
	- without treatment, can be fatal
		- progress to end-stage liver disease
			- cirrhosis 
			- hepatocellular carcinoma
	-  strongly associated with
		- [[Metabolic Syndrome]]
			- movement to rename NAFL to "metabolic fatty liver disease"
			- movement to rename nonalcoholic steatohepatitis to "metabolic steatohepatitis"
		- insulin resistance
	- May develop from 
		- *NAFL* (20--30% of cases)
		- obesity
		- diabetes
		- dyslipidemia
		- hypertension
	- histologic findings
		- lipid deposition
		- inflammatory cell infiltration
		- ballooning degneration of hepatocytes
		- fibrosis
	- difficult to distinguish from NAFL by non-invasive examination
	- Gold standard for dianosis:
		- liver biopsy
		- exclusion of secondary causes
### Global prevalence: 25% (Younossim et al.)
- expected to increase with increasing prevalence of obesity

### Etiology and pathophysiology of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease/nonalcoholic steatohepatitis

#### Two-hit Theory (Day and James)
- First hit
	- sedentary lifestyle
	- high-fat diet
	- obesity
	- insulin resistance
- Effect of first hit on Liver
	- enhanced lipid accumulation in the liver
	- liver susceptible to further damage
- Second hit
	- further damage to the liver
		- proinflammatory cytokines
		- gut microbiota-derived components
		- oxidative stress
		- lipid peroxide
- Effect of Second hit on liver
	- Necrotic inflammation
	- Fibrosis
- Two-hit theory not enough to explain Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease
#### Multiple parallel hits hypothesis
- currently accepted theory
- two-hit theory + environment + genetics + changes in various organs (adipose tissuee, intestine, pancreeas, liver)
#### Diagnosis

##### 1) Biopsy - gold standard;
	- When to consider?
		-  differentiate between other diseases
		- suspected nonalcoholic steatohepatitis
##### Histological findings
- Matteoni's criteria (histological characteristics)
	- Type I - steatosis only
	- Type II - steatosis + lobular inflammation
	- *Type III* - steatosis + hepatocellular ballooning 
	- *Type IV* - Type III + Mallory-Denk bodies or fibrosis) 
	- Types III and IV = *nonalcoholic steatohepatitis*
- Brunt's criteria (Grade -degree of inflammation + Stage- degree of fibrosis) 
- Kleiner 
	- scoring criteria according to
		- degree of steatosis, degree of lobular inflammation, frequency of hepatocyte ballooning
	- aggregated scores to define the fibrosis score and activity score
##### 2) Abdominal sonography and computed tomography
##### 3) Blood Biomarkers
- Serum alanine aminotransferase
- Aspartate aminotransferase
- Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase
- Platelets
- Albumin
- Triglyceride
- Cholinesterase
- Fasting plasma insulin
- Homeostasis model of assessment of insulin resistance

##### 4) Formula scoring systems
- Based on
	- gender
	- age
	- BMI
	- impaired fasting glycemia/diabetes
	- aspartate aminotransferase:alanine aminotransferase ratio
	- platelet
	- albumin
A. Fibrosis score
- predicts cases of advanced fibrosis
B. Fatty liver Index
- predicts onset of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease
C. Hepatic steatosis index
- simplifies nonalcoholic fatty liver disease evaluation
# Epidemiologic Relationship between Periodontal disease and NAFLD
- poor oral hygiene contributed to liver cirrhosis
- greater bone loss in patients with cirrhosis

## Cross-sectional studies

### **Biomarkers**
*Saito* 
- blood biomarkers were increased in periodontitis patients and proportional to the severity (linear multiple regression analysis
- serum alanine aminotransferase levels (multiple logistic regression analysis)
	- normal in 95.8% of nonperiodontitis patients and 4.2% of periodontitis patients
	- abnormal levels in 87.4% of nonperiodontitis patients and 12.6% of periodontitis patients
	- significant relationship only found in males, none for females.

### **Images and/or Scoring systems**
*Alazawi*
- PPD of ≥3mm were 7.5% in the low NAFLD fibrosis group and 14.7% in the moderate to high NAFLD fibrosis group.
- CAL higher in the high NAFLD fibrosis group
- Development of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis patients had higher incidence of periodontitis
- nonalcohoholic steatohepatitis with higher fibrosis score = 33% had periodontitis, while only 3% had periodontitis in the simple steatosis group.

*Akinkugbe et al*
- found no association between periodontitis and NAFLD for hispanic and latinos

*Weintraub et al*
Odds ratio for the association of periodontitis and fatty liver disease was 1.54 using ultrasonography, 3.10 for NAFLD fibrosis score, 1.61 for fatty liver index, ad 2.21 for US fatty liver index (takes into account ethnic differences)

*Iwasaki et al*
86.9% in NAFLD patients diagnosed with ultrasonography and 72.9% of NAFLD patients had pocket depths of 4mm of more.

### Other markers
a) *Periodontal pathogenic bacteria*
*Komazaki*
- anti-AA antibodies, positive correlation w/ total fat area, visceral fat area, fasting plasma insulin, a homeostasis model of assessment of insulin resistance, and aspartate aminotransferase
- no correlation w/ alanine amninotransferase or gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase
- P. gingivalis no correlation w/ any liver parameters
- negative correlation w/ liver-spleen ratio when assessed by abdominal computed tomography
- Anti Fusobacterium nucleatum antibodies had a significant correlation with total fat area

b) *C-reactive protein*
*Akinkugbe et al
- C-reactive protein = inflammation-induced burden
- prevalence of NAFLD in 2481 of populations in Pomerania (NE Germany) = 26.4%
	- 18.1% in subjects without periodontitis
	- 26.6% in patients with localized periodontitis
	- 39.2% in generalized periodontitis
- CRP <1mg/L, adjusted odds ratio for NAFLD was 2.39 for the generalized periodontitis group
- CRP 1-3 mg/L and greater than 3 mg/L odds ratio was 0.97 and 1.12
- significant association b/w periodontitis and NAFLD in subjects with low levels of CRP but no relationship found at higher levels of CRP
- CRP may be a modifier of the relationship b/w periodontitis and NAFLD

c) *Serum IGG antibody titers against P. gingivalis*
*Nakahara et al.*
P gingivalis A types 1 and 4 - higher in advanced fibrosis
type 4 - higher in advanced stages of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis

3.2 Case control studies
*Yoneda et al*
NAFLD and P gingivalis
- Biopsy
- P gingivalis quantified by PCR
- 52% for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis
- 35.4% for NAFLD
- 27.4% for controls 
*Nakiahara*
- 200 patients diagnosed with NAFLD by biopsy
- Serum antibody titers for P. Gingivalis fimbriae A types 1, 2, 3 4.
- types 1 and 4 significantly higher in cases w/ advanced fibrosis
- Type 4 titers higher in advanced stages of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.

# Relationship between periodontal disease, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease/nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and metabolic syndrome

## Role of metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance in the pathophysiology of NAFLD/nonalcoholic steatohepatitis

The hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome is considered to be nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) b/c of its close association with obesity, insulin resistance, hypertension, and dyslipidemia.

![[Metabolic Syndrome]]

Obesity
- strongly associated with development of NAFLD
- causes fat accumulation in the lier through insulin resistance
- Function of adiposed tissue
	- energy consumption regulation
	- regulates insulin sensitivity
	- regulation of inflammatory process via inflammatory mediators
- Effect of obesity
	- excess adipose tissue causes increased macrophafe infiltration
	- disruption of adipocytokine production (IL-1B, IL-6, TNF-alpha, leptin, resistin, visfatin, adiponectin, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, etc.) 
		- causes insulin resistance + low-grade systemic inflammation
			- leads to hepatic fat accumulation, inflammation and insulin resistance
	- disruption of insulin secretion
		- insulin functions
			- promotes glucose uptake
			- promotes fat storage
Risk Factors for NAFLD
- excess BMI
- visceral obesity
- 2/3rds of patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes have hepatic steatosis.
- Metaboli syndrome + NAFLD >>> more severe liver disease; progression from Simple Steosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and cirrhosis >>> liver failure

4.2 # Bidirectional relationship between periodontal disease and NAFLD
- NAFLD is closely associated with metabolic syndrome
- Periodontal disease is bidirectionally associated with metabolic syndrome
- consider periodontal disease in the pathology of NAFLD
- Basis
	- epidemiologid studies have shown that periodontal disease can exacerbate other metabolic disorders such as diabetes, dyslipidemia, and chronic kidney disease.
- Proposed mechanism
	- the systemic inflammation caused by periodontitis may contribute to insulin resistance through elevated levels of adipocytokines, such as TNF-alpha, IL-6, and leptin, which inhibt the insulin receptor and its downstream signaling.  
	- obesity + periodontitis
		- inc. risk for diabetes
	- promotion

Cohort Study - Observational study that takes place over a period of time to investigate the association between exposure to a risk factor or an intervention and the occurence of an outcome, such as disease or resolution of a disease.  
- prospective - subjects are identified then observed; baseline data is first collected then followed over time to assess the occurence of an outcome  
- retrospective - you go through medical records, identifying the patients based on exposure status.  

Case control study 
- observational study where you investigate the association between a risk factor and the occurence of an outcome.  Participants with a certain disease/outcome are compared to individuals without the outcome (control group) to assess the differences.  

Cross-sectional study - observational study where you investigate the prevalence of a condition in a defined population at a certain point in time 
- gather demographic data, medical history, behaviors that affect their health and then the presence/absence of a certain condition.

AST / ALT ratio increase as liver function decreases
- AST is found in hepatocytes and in other tissues 
- ALT is primarily found in hepatocytes
